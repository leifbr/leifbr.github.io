<p><a class="reference external" href="https://f5.com/de/products/technologies/scalen">*https://f5.com/de/products/technologies/scalen*</a></p>
<p><strong>How many F5 devices do you need?</strong></p>
<p>This question is partly about redundancy and partly about sizing. You
can look at how much capacity a customer will need based on throughput,
planning for growth, etc. and pick the right sized hardware appliance or
virtual appliance, to fit their needs. And a single appliance may fit
the capacity needs; however, it does not provide redundancy in the event
of hardware (appliance or hypervisor) failure. So, when determining how
many you need there is always a need for redundancy. If you deploy in an
HA pair for redundancy you can run them as Active/Standby or
Active/Active. Neither of these redundancy modes allows for more
capacity. It is simply a different means of failover management. The F5
ScaleN redundancy deployment model will allow for redundancy as well as
capacity management and is discussed in more detail in this document.</p>

<p><strong>4.01 - Determine high availability options</strong></p>

<p><strong>High Availability</strong></p>
<p>Device service clustering, or DSC, is an underlying architecture within
BIG-IP Traffic Management Operation System (TMOS), based on the F5
ScaleN technology. The DSC architecture allows you to create a redundant
system configuration for multiple BIG-IP devices on a network. System
redundancy includes the ability to mirror connection and persistence
information to a peer device to prevent service interruptions during
failover. DSC provides synchronization and failover of BIG-IP
configuration data at user-defined levels of granularity, among multiple
BIG-IP devices on a network. More specifically, you can configure a
BIG-IP device on a network to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Synchronize some or all of its configuration data among several
BIG-IP devices</li>
<li>Fail over to one of many available devices</li>
<li>Mirror connections to a peer device to prevent interruption in
service during failover</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have two BIG-IP devices only, you can create either an
active-standby or an active-active configuration. With more than two
devices, you can create a configuration in which multiple devices are
active and can fail over to one of many, if necessary.</p>
<p>By setting up DSC, you ensure that BIG-IP configuration objects are
synchronized and can fail over at useful levels of granularity to the
most-available BIG-IP devices on the network. You also ensure that
failover from one device to another, when enabled, occurs seamlessly,
with minimal to no interruption in application delivery.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system supports either homogeneous or heterogeneous hardware
platforms within a device group.</p>
<p>The most common DSC implementation is an active-standby configuration,
where a single traffic group is active on one of the devices in the
device group and is in a standby state on a peer device. If failover
occurs, the standby traffic group on the peer device becomes active and
begins processing the application traffic.</p>
<p>To implement this DSC implementation, you can create a Sync-Failover
device group. A Sync-Failover device group with two or more members and
one traffic group provides configuration synchronization and device
failover, and optionally, connection mirroring.</p>
<p>An active-active pair is a pair of BIG-IP devices configured so that
both devices are actively processing traffic and are ready to take over
one another if failover occurs. The two devices synchronize their
configuration data to one another.</p>
<p>In this configuration, both devices actively process application
traffic, each for a different application. One device processes its
application traffic using the configuration objects associated with the
default floating traffic group</p>
<p>F5 ScaleN technology enables organizations to scale performance,
virtualize, or horizontally cluster multiple BIG-IP devices, creating an
elastic Application Delivery Networking infrastructure that can
efficiently adapt as needs change.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">On-demand scalingâIncrease capacity and performance with on-demand
scaling, simply adding more power to your existing infrastructure
instead of adding devices. Some BIG-IP appliance models can be
upgraded to the higher performance model within each series through
on-demand software licensing, which enables organizations to support
growth without new hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Operational scalingâVirtualize ADC services with a multi-tenant
architecture that supports a variety of BIG-IP versions and product
modules on a single device. F5 Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing
(vCMP) technology enables select hardware platforms to run multiple
BIG-IP guest instances. Each guest instance acts like a physical
BIG-IP device, with a dedicated allocation of CPU, memory, and other
resources. vCMP offers per-guest rate limiting for bandwidth,
enabling different performance levels for each guest.</p>
<p>Further divide each vCMP guest using multi-tenant features such as
partitions and route domains, which can isolate configuration and
networks on a per-virtual-domain basis. Within each virtual domain,
you can further isolate and secure configuration and policies, with
a role-based access system for administrative control. When route
domains/partitions are combined with vCMP guests, F5 provides the
highest density multi-tenant virtualization solution, which can
scale to thousands of virtual ADC (vADC) instances.</p>
<p>This ability to virtualize BIG-IP ADC services means service
providers and enterprise users can isolate based on BIG-IP version,
enabling departmental or project-based tenancy as well as
performance guarantees, consolidated application delivery platform
management, and increased utilization.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Application scalingâIncrease capacity by adding BIG-IP resources
through an</p>
<p>all-active approach, and scale beyond the traditional device pair to
eliminate idle and costly standby resources. Application scaling
achieves this through two forms of horizontal scale. One is
Application Service Clustering, which focuses on application
scalability and high availability. The other is Device Service
Clustering, designed to efficiently and seamlessly scale BIG-IP
application delivery services and sync application policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Application Service Clustering delivers sub-second failover and
comprehensive connection mirroring for a highly available cluster of up
to eight devices at the application layer, providing highly available
multi-tenant deployments. Workloads can be moved across a cluster of
devices or virtual instances without interrupting other services and can
be scaled to meet business demand.</p>
<p>Device Service Clustering can synchronize full device configurations in
an all-active deployment model, enabling consistent policy deployment
and enforcement across devicesâup to 32 active nodes. This ensures a
consistent device configuration, with syncing of hardened firewall and
access policies to simplify operations and reduce attack surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Virtualization</strong></p>
<p>Data center consolidation and virtualization have changed the way
organizations look at CapEx and OpEx. Gone are the days when adding new
capacity or applications was simply accomplished by buying âmore.â
Today, CIOs and architects are looking to maximize the return on
investment in hardware and software through virtualization technologies
that enable them to squeeze every ounce of computing power from their
existing data centers.</p>
<p>This is most apparent in the world of application servers, but the
potential benefits for other devices, firewalls, routers, and
Application Delivery Controllers (ADCs) cannot be ignored. Consequently,
most vendors offer strategies around multi-tenancy or virtual appliances
in one form or another to provide the same kind of flexibility for their
solutions that OS virtualization offers in the server world.</p>
<p>While both multi-tenancy and virtual appliances improve organizationsâ
deployment flexibility and their ability to get maximum ROI from both
CapEx and short-term OpEx, these strategies have failed to provide the
same kind of high-reliability, high-performance solutions as traditional
purpose-built systems.</p>

<p><strong>F5 Virtual Edition Supported Platforms</strong></p>
<p>Each customer may have different virtualization environments with in
their data centers, private cloud or even different pubic clouds which
each have their own hypervisors. F5 virtual editions can run on many
different versions of hypervisors. The link below shows the full matrix
of hypervisors our VE can run on. You should be aware of our flexibility.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.f5.com/services/resources/white-papers/virtual-clustered-multiprocessing-vcmp">https://www.f5.com/services/resources/white-papers/virtual-clustered-multiprocessing-vcmp</a></p>
<p><strong>F5 vCMP</strong></p>
<p>Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing (vCMP) is the industryâs first
purpose-built hypervisorâit allows the complete segmentation of those
purpose-built, scalable resources into independent, virtual ADCs.</p>
<p>vCMP allows a BIG-IP system to run multiple instances of BIG-IP software
on a single hardware platform. The vCMP host (hypervisor) can allocate a
specific amount of hardware resources to each vCMP guest (instance). The
possible hardware allocations may change between versions.</p>
<p>The payoff of a purpose-built hypervisor thatâs deeply integrated with
the underlying hardware and guest software is the most powerful
virtualized ADC solution available today. With vCMP, organizations can
independently operate virtual instances without sacrificing
interoperability with existing equipment, purpose-built hardware, or
orchestration solutions.</p>
<p>With vCMP, administrators can run multiple instances of TMOS, each
isolated from the others. Unlike some implementations, because vCMP is a
true hypervisor, the guest ADCs are completely isolatedâso they can run
entirely different versions of ADC software. This means that test and
development staff can create new virtual ADC instances to test new
versions of software without any effect on existing deployments. Or,
competing business units can choose if/when they upgrade their virtual
instances to meet their unique business requirements. All they have to
do is provision a new instance, apply their existing configuration, and
then test the upgrade process and results. Any problems can be addressed
by simply removing the instance and starting over. Alternatively,
administrators can upgrade individual instances in place without having
to upgrade all instances.</p>
<p>Because each guest is its own complete ADC, individual business units or
other customers have complete control over their deployment, the ability
to further segment their deployment using administrative controls, and
the ability to manage independent logs and configurations. However, a
failure or misstep cannot affect any other virtual instance. Rebooting
the instance, runaway processes, and flat-out misconfigurations are
isolated from all other instances.</p>
<p>The deep integration of vCMP also enables it to work seamlessly with
existing functionality. For instance, CMP allows new compute resources
to be added incrementally and become instantly available to the ADC.
When vCMP is in operation, those new resources can be automatically
allocated to existing virtual instances without any interruption,
reboot, or reconfiguration. On the other side of the stack, when
configuring vCMP guest allocation, the hypervisor can directly assign IP
addresses for management and VLAN tags along with the resource
allocation restrictions. Creating a new ADC instance can be done in a
matter of minutes, and a new administrator can log in and start their
configuration. Other vendorsâ virtual ADC solutions require reboot of
virtual instances before new resources are available, and each instance
must be manually configured before being ready for further
configuration. vCMP allows virtual instances full access to new network
interfaces, VLANs, and even entirely new resource blades instantly and
without interruption.</p>
<p>Flexible allocation allows administrators to designate CPU resources
(and blades on chassis models) to guests upon creation. Dynamic scaling
allows reallocation of CPU resources, without disruption. This makes it
possible to redistribute resources to better align with the need for
business agility in addressing growth and scale, as well as support
additional or new application delivery services that may require more
CPU resources. Administrators can size guests according to whatâs
required for each deploymentâand modify when those requirements change.</p>

<p><strong>BIP-IP iSeries Hardware</strong></p>
<p>The massive performance and scalability of the BIG-IP platform reduces
the number of ADCs needed to deliver even the most demanding
applications. By offloading computationally intense processes, you can
significantly reduce the number of application servers needed.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP iSeries platform perfectly blends software and hardware
innovations that balance the need for performance, scalability, and
agility. The F5 TMOS operating system provides total visibility,
flexibility, and control across all application delivery services. With
TMOS, organizations can intelligently adapt to the diverse and evolving
requirements of applications and networks. Other unique or patented
hardware and software innovations enable the BIG-IP iSeries platform to
offer unmatched capabilities.</p>
<p>F5 TurboFlex optimization technology:</p>
<p>Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), tightly integrated with
CPUs, memory, TMOS, and software, provide specific packet-flow
optimizations, L4 offload, support for private cloud tunneling
protocols, and denial-of- service (DoS) protection. These hardware
optimizations not only improve performance but free CPU capacity for
other app delivery and security tasks. Only BIG-IP iSeries
appliances feature TurboFlex performance profilesâuser-selectable,
pre-packaged optimizations that provide different performance
characteristics depending on the business need.</p>
<p>FIPS Compliance:</p>
<p>The Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) specify
requirements for cryptographic modules. FIPS compliance is required
for many government agencies and industries such as financial
services and healthcare that demand the highest standards in
information, application, and data security. F5 offers a broad range
of FIPS-certified hardware appliances that support a FIPS 140-2
Level 2 implementation for RSA cryptographic key generation, use,
and protection (when running validated versions of TMOS). For
additional protection, the BIG-IP 10350v-F/i7820-DF/i5820-DF
supports a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 implementation of the Internal HSM
(PCI card). BIG-IP Hardware FIPS appliances include integrated HSMs
that have tamper-evident seals with a hardened-epoxy cover which, if
removed, will render the card useless. Keys generated on or imported
into a BIG-IP system hardware security module (HSM) are not
extractable in a plain-text format. This security rating means the
10350v-F/ i7820-DF/i5820-DF HSM card adds tamper-resistance, which
is an additional means of detection to the tamper-evident methods of
Level 2, as well as a response to physical access attempts, or to
cryptographic module use or tampering.</p>
<p>vCMP Support:</p>
<p>Not all models of hardware support provisioning vCMP. The list of
models that can provision vCMP are listed in this link:
<a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14088">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14088</a> . There are not any
physical differences between the lower iSeries model and the higher
model (i.e. i5600 and i5800). There is simply a software restriction
that makes the lower model exist. The higher model is simply running
a high-performance license. If a customer buys an i5600 and later
wants to upgrade to an i5800, it can be done without a forklift
upgrade of hardware by applying the upgrade license and all the
functionality of the i5800 (e.g. vCMP) is possible on their existing
hardware.</p>

<p><strong>4.02 - Determine appropriate licensing solution (Perpetual, Utility, ELA, Subscription, BYOL)</strong></p>
<p><strong>F5 Consumption Models</strong></p>
<p>No matter which features and capabilities of TMOS a customer needs (e.g.
load balancing, global load balancing, WAF, IP intelligence, web fraud
protection, etc.) using Good, Better, Best (GBB) (discussed in Section
3) and add-on licenses, they still have licensing options on how they
consume the F5 products in their environments (Perpetual, Utility,
Subscription or ELA).</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.f5.com/products/get-f5/perpetual-licensing-gbb">https://www.f5.com/products/get-f5/perpetual-licensing-gbb</a></p>
<p><strong>Perpetual/BYOL</strong></p>
<p>All F5 physical hardware and Virtual Editions are licensed with a
perpetual license key based on the GGB licensing model and add-on
licenses. These devices can be run in a customerâs data center, their
private cloud or even a public cloud. When a VE is deployed in the
public cloud using a perpetual license key, it is considered a BYOL in
the Cloud. There are other licensing models for cloud environments that
we will cover below.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://f5.com/products/platforms/f5-ready-cloud-program">https://f5.com/products/platforms/f5-ready-cloud-program</a></p>
<p><strong>Utility/PAYG</strong></p>
<p>Utility (pay-as-you-go) using GBB enables an hourly, daily, or monthly
billing model to support temporal deployments like dev &amp; test or for
customers who prefer the OpEx model.</p>

<p><strong>Subscription Licensing</strong></p>
<p>Subscription Licensing Offer for BIG-IP VE is an auto-renewal agreement
for BIG-IP VE licenses using GBB, available in 1-year, 2-year, and
3-year periods. Within the agreement, organizations choose local BIG-IP
VE licenses at subscription initiation. The initial order of
subscription licenses is populated in F5 BIG-IQ License Manager and is
available for immediate deployment. Subscription Licensing Offer for
BIG-IP VE enables IT departments to self- manage their lifecycles.
License instantiation or revocation can be done via the BIG-IQ License
Manager either directly or via REST API. Net-new licenses from the
BIG-IP VE Subscription list can be instantiated at any time. Activity
reports are provided monthly to F5 via BIG-IQ API upload or email. F5
Premium 24x7 support and software updates are included in the
subscription.</p>

<p><strong>Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)</strong></p>
<p>F5âs ELA is a licensing model designed to support your customersâ need
for more flexibility how they buy and deploy their investment in F5.
F5âs ELA is a 3-year monetary commitment for BIG-IP VEâs (e.g. LTM, ASM,
AFM, DNS, APM) that the customer deploys as needed when needed at a
predictable yearly cost.</p>

- BIG-IP Power Cabling</p>
<p>As a sales engineer you will often need to create a Bill of Materials
(BoM). You can take all of the sizing information that determined what
F5 products will fit the customerâs needs and information you have
gathered to support the implementation of F5 in the customers
environment to create this list of necessary goods. You would normally
need the F5 price sheet for the SKU numbers that correlate to the parts
you need for the BoM. You will not need to know SKU numbers for the
exam. The exam may present you with a list of requirements and an
example BoM to have you determine what is missing or is not necessary.</p>
<p>You will generally need the F5 platform, possibly blades if it is
chassis-based solution and modular interfaces. iSeries models above the
i5000 series ship with redundant power supplies and are optional on
i5000 series and down. The Viprion chassis will need to be scoped for
power needs based on the modelâs power or platform guides. That can be
found as a link off of the Viprion datasheet, which is linked above.</p>
<p>All devices ship with standard C19 to NEMA 5-20P in US/CANADA, so
normally you will need to understand if that will work in the customerâs
environment but as it is an exam is it there or not is the point.</p>
<p>F5&nbsp;does not support third party transceivers or other hardware.</p>
<p>If there are 40GB interfaces and going with 10GB breakout cable requires
both the breakout cable and the transceivers. You must purchase the 40
GbE port transceivers for the F5 device from F5, as well as the
appropriate 10 GB port transceivers for the upstream switch from your
switch vendor.</p>
<p>For BIG-IP and VIPRION platforms that support 40 GbE ports, F5 provides
QSFP+ breakout cable options to convert a single 40 GbE port to four 10
GB ports. The QSFP+ breakout cable has a female MPO/MTP connector on one
end for connecting to the QSFP+ port on the VIPRION or BIG-IP device and
four LC duplex connectors on the other end for connecting to the SFP+
modules on an upstream switch. These cables do not have any active
components/transceivers on either end. F5 offers three length options
for the QSFP+ breakout cable, one meter, three meters, and 10 meters. If
you require QSFP+ breakout cable length other than the three lengths
offered by F5, you may be able to purchase QSFP+ breakout cables of
equivalent specifications from third-party vendors.</p>
