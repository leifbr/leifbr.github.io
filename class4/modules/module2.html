<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/big-ip-application-security-manager-ds.pdf">https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/big-ip-application-security-manager-ds.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>BIG-IP Application Security Manager/Advanced Application Security
Manager</strong></p>
<p>BIG-IP Application Security Manager (ASM) is a flexible web application
firewall that secures web applications in traditional, virtual, and
private cloud environments. BIG-IP ASM provides unmatched application
and website protection, complete information about attacks from within
the user interface, and compliance for key regulatory mandates. BIG-IP
ASM is a key part of the F5 application delivery firewall solution,
which consolidates traffic management, network firewall, application
access, DDoS protection, SSL inspection, and DNS security</p>
<p><em>Protect web and mobile applications from malicious bots</em></p>
<p>F5 secures an organizationâs most valued assets, applications, and
sensitive data from bots, automated attacks, web scrapers, and
exploits. Advanced WAF extends bot protection to mobile applications
through the F5 Anti-Bot Mobile SDK, providing rapid deployment of
mobile bot protection through an easy-to-use web portal without
requiring any changes to the application or mobile device.
Applications fused with mobile bot protection are supported in
vendor and third-party application stores.</p>
<p><em>Safeguard credentials and sensitive data from theft and abuse</em></p>
<p>Advanced WAF secures credentials and sensitive data from theft and
abuse, preventing data breaches and mitigating automated attacks
that leverage previously stolen credentials. F5 BIG-IP DataSafe
application layer encryption in Advanced WAF masks sensitive fields
directly within the userâs web browser, rendering data stolen by bad
actors through client-side attacks useless. Using BIG-IP DataSafe,
customers can encrypt data at the field level transparently, without
requiring any changes on clients or Web servers. Comprehensive brute
force mitigation including credential stuffing protection defends
against automated attacks that leverage previously stolen
credentials.</p>
<p><em>Defend against sophisticated application denial-of-service (DoS)</em></p>
<p>Advanced WAF discovers and fingerprints new and unusual traffic
patterns without human intervention, distinguishing and isolating
potential malicious traffic from legitimate traffic. This automated
mitigation capability is based on a continuous feedback loop of
client behavior and server stress. If anomalous behavior is
detected, Advanced WAF automatically builds a dynamic signature and
begins mitigating the attack. The effectiveness of the mitigation is
then monitored through the continuous feedback loop. False positives
are reduced while accuracy and performance are improved through
continuous mitigation tuning as the attack starts, evolves, or
stops.</p>
<p><em>Mitigate sophisticated threat campaigns</em></p>
<p>Threat Campaigns provide targeted signatures to protect
organizations from pervasive attacks that are often coordinated by
organized crime and nation states. Based on F5 Labs research, Threat
Campaigns provide critical intelligence to fingerprint and mitigate
sophisticated attacks with nearly real-time updates. Metadata is
used to determine both malicious requests and malicious intent, and
the high accuracy of Threat Campaign signatures immediately blocks
active threats with low false positives and no learning cycle.</p>
<p><em>Protect APIs</em></p>
<p>As web applications expand from connected to collaborative via the
extensive use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), Advanced
WAF ensures that API methods are enforced on URLs. It also secures
applications against API attacks that commonly go undetected by
traditional firewalls. With a unique defense mechanism that guards
XML, JSON, and GTW APIs through rate limiting, behavioral analysis,
and anti-automation, Advanced WAF automatically detects application
program interface threats, enforces strict policy rules for each use
case, and blocks attacks and special content typesâclosing the back
door on application threats. With F5 Access Manager, API protection
is improved through comprehensive authentication and token
enforcement.</p>
<p><em>Ensure application security and compliance</em></p>
<p>Gain comprehensive security against sophisticated layer 7 attacks,
blocking threats that evade traditional WAFs and enabling compliance
with key regulatory mandates.</p>
<p><em>Turn on protection immediately</em></p>
<p>Simplify security with pre-built policies, thousands of
out-of-the-box signatures, and a streamlined approach to policy
management that decreases operational expenses.</p>
<p><em>Patch vulnerabilities fast</em></p>
<p>Identify and resolve app vulnerabilities in minutes with leading
dynamic application security testing (DAST) integration and
automatic virtual patching.</p>
<p><em>Deploy flexibly</em></p>
<p>Deploy as an appliance, in virtual or cloud environments, and as a
managed service supporting multi-tenant services while incorporating
external intelligence that secures against known IP threats.</p>
<p><em>Defend with proven advanced protections</em></p>
<p>Defend with highly programmable technology that dynamically adapts
policies, proactively stops bots and DoS attacks, and demonstrates
99.89% overall security effectiveness.</p>
<p><em>Magnify threat knowledge</em></p>
<p>Easily understand your security status with detailed forensic
analysis, full visibility into HTTP and WebSocket traffic, and rich
insight into all events and user types.</p>

improves URL classification.</p>
<p><em>Web security</em></p>
<p>Secure Web Gateway Services also detects and blocks malware or
malicious scripts within web pages by scanning return HTTP/HTTPS
traffic. The malware engine contains web malware analytics,
signatures, and heuristic detection engines that identify and
eradicate general and specialized threats. When a remote user
accesses the web through a per-app VPN tunnel in BIG-IP APM, Secure
Web Gateway Services protects the session as though the user was on
the corporate network. Authentication, URL filtering, and malware
scanning polices are applied. Secure Web Gateway Services can also
bypass or block SSL websites (based on inspection) for privacy and
compliance purposesâenabling flexible control for access to
SSL-encrypted websites.</p>
<p><em>Real-time threat intelligence</em></p>
<p>Leveraging the Forcepoint cloud-based threat intelligence
infrastructure to deliver constant, up-to-date security information,
Secure Web Gateway Services detects threats within web and social
networking content. It synchronizes with Forcepoint cloud-based
threat intelligence on a user-configurable schedule.</p>
<p><em>User identification</em></p>
<p>Secure Web Gateway Services keeps track of the mapping between user
identity and network addresses while enabling transparent,
user-based security policies through the F5 User Identity Agent. The
User Identity Agent runs on a Windows-based server and pulls
information from Active Directory domain controllers, enabling
Secure Web Gateway Services to fully track a userâs web activity by
user identity or group membership.</p>
<p><em>Graphical security reporting and comprehensive logging</em></p>
<p>The graphical user interface within Secure Web Gateway Services lets
system administrators view and export various security analytics
reports. These reports empower administrators with total visibility
of outbound and inbound web traffic, Internet use, and policy
enforcement. Logs may be published through the F5 log publisher to
well- known security information and event management (SIEM)
solutions, including ArcSight and Splunk for longer-term storage and
analytics.</p>

<p><strong>Value of F5 - BIG-IP Application Security Manager /Advanced WAF</strong></p>
<p>Applications are critical to your business. Without the right
protection, however, they can become an attack vector that may
ultimately lead to a data breach. Consider this alarming statistic:
Organizations have an average of 765 web applications and these
applications are the initial target of data breaches 53% of the time.
Web application firewalls (WAF) protect your applications from data
breaches by fixing vulnerabilities and stopping attacks.</p>

<p>This section is very similar with section 1.03 just from a different
point of view. You need to be able to educate the customer on what
problems our products solve. The IT acronym machine has been running
strong for decades and talking in acronyms especially proprietary
product acronyms is not a good way to improve the customers
understanding of what F5 does. So, being able to correlate F5âs three
letter product offerings to the industry standard name of the solution
that can meet the customerâs needs is key. If a customer needs to block
cross-site scripting (XSS) on their primary internet facing application,
you should be able to say which product from F5 can solve their issue.
There are many solutions with our products and you should be familiar
with them all.</p>
