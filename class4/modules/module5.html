<p><strong>5.01 - Distinguish needs of buying powers and influencers</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/blog/sales-trends/2018/08/what-are-influencers--and-how-do-they-affect-the-b2b-buyer-s-jou">https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/blog/sales-trends/2018/08/what-are-influencersâand-how-do-they-affect-the-b2b-buyer-s-jou</a></p>
<p>You cannot expect that you are the only one that has influence on the
buyer in your prospective customer. There are many different
influencers. This article from LinkedIn has a great perspective of how
influencers can impact your sales opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Influencer Impact at Each Stage of the Deal</strong></p>
<p>Itâs important to understand how various influencers affect your deal at
different stages of the purchase process. While it is impossible to
distill this to a one-size-fits-all mapping, we can make some useful
generalizations.</p>
<p>An effective practice is to review the type of content buyers seek at
each stage of the purchase journey and map these content types to the
field of external influencers. After all, content is simply an
information vehicle, just as influencers are an information source.</p>
<p>In the early stage, buyers usually seek out thought leadership and
educational content. As such, they will consult external experts who can
inform their understanding of top issues and trends during cursory
research. These could include analysts, subject matter experts, and
thought leaders. As a result, top-of-funnel prospects might come to the
table with preconceived notions they gathered from one or more industry
influencers.</p>
<p><em>Early-Stage Influence Takeaway:</em></p>
<p>Become familiar with respected authorities in your niche and keep a bead
on their content or social media updates to better understand viewpoints
and perspectives that might be instilled in your prospects.</p>
<p>Prospects in the middle stage want to evaluate and narrow down their
options. At this point, they consume more product-specific content along
with case studies, comparisons, and evaluation guides. According to
research by Influitive, nearly 90% of buyers are influenced by customer
testimonials during the purchase decision.</p>
<p>When consulting internal influencers at this stage, prospects often call
upon those can help evaluate both business and technical details, such
as IT and engineering. For external perspectives, they might turn to
respected peers, partners, and customers of the vendor under
consideration.</p>
<p><em>Middle-Stage Influence Takeaway:</em></p>
<p>Customer testimonials and peer reviews are key as buyers begin to narrow
their options and gravitate toward a decision.</p>
<p>In the final stage of their journey, buyers need to validate their
purchase decision. They vet their choice through content such as demos,
total cost of ownership, and ROI calculators. It is common at this point
to again enlist the input of peers, partners, and existing customers.
Additionally, buyers will seek to generate consensus on the purchase
committee, and throughout the organization. So, lower-funnel prospects
might be influenced by operations colleagues, technology stakeholders,
user-level team members, and the finance group.</p>
<p><em>Late-Stage Influence Takeaway:</em></p>
<p>Expanding your own influence across the buying committee and in other
relevant areas of the organization can help solidify consensus.</p>
<p><em>Position Yourself to Swing the Balance in Your Favor</em></p>
<p>In addition to decision makers, hidden influencers can hold sway in the
ultimate purchase choice. They can impact whether a large deal is
awarded to you or a competitor â or whether the status quo prevails.
Failing to build strong ties to even one of these influencers could lead
to the collapse of important deals.</p>
<p>The more connections you establish within and beyond a prospectâs
company, and the more you interact with these people on social media,
the more fully youâll understand how various decision makers and
influencers work together.</p>
<p>This approach empowers you to make the most of influence arriving from
any direction.</p>

<p><strong>5.02 - Utilize SMEs during technical activities</strong></p>
<p>There will be times where you will need to leverage the an F5 subject
matter expert (SME) who has a deep understanding of the F5 products.
When performing a Proof-of-Concept for a customer or if you are trying
to size an F5 product to fit the customers environment, you will need to
work with the F5 account team and local Systems Engineer. If you are a
partner trying to gain knowledge about how an F5 product or function
works you can engage the Channel SE in your region for more information
or enablement training.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<p><strong>5.02 - Determine when to advise a customer to engage F5 support</strong></p>
<p>A sales SE needs to determine the appropriate action plan or resource to
engage for F5 support. For example, if the customer has an issue during a Proof of Concept
(POC) or other presales activity, then the local F5 account manager and
F5 Field Systems Engineer (SE) should be engaged, but if a customer has an
implemented F5 solution and they are experiencing an issue, the sales
engineer will need to understand how to advise the customer to open a
support ticket with F5.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to open a support case with F5. You can
review them here in this link: <a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2633">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2633</a></p>

maintenance contracts. In addition to Standard iRules and iApps support,

within one business day. For assistance with iApps templates, use the

Understanding that unforeseen events could delay attempts, F5 expects
that most Severity 1 issues will be responded to within this service
level.</p>
<p>Initial response is defined as the time from when the F5 case was
created to when a Network Support Engineer first attempts to contact you
for troubleshooting, then updates the case log to reflect this action.</p>

<p>When a case is logged as Severity 1, F5 Network Support Managers are
immediately notified to ensure the case is assigned within the
appropriate timeframe to an appropriately skilled Network Support
Engineer.</p>

<p><strong>5.02 - Locate and determine appropriate resource for account/customer escalations</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.f5.com/services/support/support-offerings/support-policies">https://www.f5.com/services/support/support-offerings/support-policies</a></p>
<p>If at any time you believe that a case is not being handled in
accordance with the service levels in your support contract, or if you
wish to comment on the way a particular case is being addressed by a
Network Support Engineer, please contact F5 Support and request to speak
with a Technical Support Manager.</p>
<p>F5 has identified four escalation situations each requiring a different
methodology to handle and escalate.</p>
<p>The first is a situation where an NSE intuitively knows that the issue
could become troublesome. This could be caused by a number of things; a
bug is detected, an NSE feels the situation may be beyond his/her
technical depth, or it could be a matter of a customer communicating an
unusual amount of agitation. We call these common sense or situational
escalations. We encourage escalation to a manager or other technical
resource in this scenario and depend heavily on our NSEâs common sense
to determine the proper timing of the escalation.</p>
<p>The second is a time-based escalation. We preset alerts and reports in
our call management system to use as a safety valve. This allows us to
monitor proper response time, ongoing communication between all the
parties and the eventual resolution of the issue.</p>
<p>The third is a technical escalation where due to the urgent nature of
the issue events are time triggered. When a Severity 1 or 2 case is
initially generated the F5 Support Manager is immediately notified via a
preset alert. It is the Support Managers responsibility to escalation
per the steps outlined below.</p>

management.</p>

<p>The Support Manager will manage events and action plans throughout the
duration of the case. The Support Manager may assign additional F5
resources as required and will determine communications to F5 resources
and senior management.</p>

F5 NSC refers to when logging a new case or changing severity

<p><strong>5.03 - Define evaluation hardware and software tools and processes</strong></p>
<p>The presales SE can leverage the following tools.</p>
<p><strong>Strongbox Demo Appliance and License Site</strong></p>
<p>The F5 StrongBox program provides F5 UNITY Partners with an easy,
cost-effective way to allow their customers to test drive F5 technology.
StrongBox units are individually customized for each customer
evaluation. Once the evaluation is complete, the box is reset and
re-customized for the next evaluation assignment.</p>
<p>The StrongBox program is available for BIG-IP evaluation hardware and
Virtual Edition products. The hardware evaluation units are priced at
F5âs hardware cost, making them very affordable, and there is no limit
to the number of StrongBox units you can deploy. Since the StrongBox
unit is reusable, it offers a fantastic return on investment. In
addition, F5 Sales Representatives use partner StrongBox units as their
principal means of fulfilling customer evaluation requirements, so your
StrongBox could open doors to new, pre-qualified opportunities. Presales
engineers can also generate Strongbox 30-45-day Virtual Edition (VE)
licenses to use for customer evaluations.</p>
