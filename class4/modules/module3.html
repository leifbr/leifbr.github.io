<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.f5.com/solutions/application-security/ddos-protection">https://www.f5.com/solutions/application-security/ddos-protection</a></p>
<p><strong>DDoS Protection</strong></p>
<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks threaten businesses with
downtime that can damage their brand and even lead to financial losses.
With the many IoT device-powered botnets and for-hire DDoS services, the
threat of an attack is greater than ever. F5 provides DDoS protection
across the range of attack vectors and at each level of the application.</p>
<p>Volumetric DoS attacks consume all available bandwidth across the
network link that connects an application to the Internet or other
networks. Computational DoS attacks attempt to exhaust infrastructure
resources, such as firewall state tables, leading to crashing or
degraded performance. Application DoS attacks mimic legitimate
application requests but attempt to overload web server resources such
as CPU or memory.</p>
<p>Applications can be attacked at many different levels. Below are just a
sample of the types of application attacks at each level.
<strong>Network Level DoS</strong></p>
<p><em>SYN Flood</em></p>
<p>Every client-server conversation begins with a standard three-way
handshake. The client sends a SYN packet, the server responds with a
SYN-ACK, and the TCP connection is established with a final client ACK.
In a SYN flood attack the client sends massive numbers of SYN requests,
and never responds to the SYN-ACK messages from the server.</p>
<p>This leaves the server with open connections waiting for responses from
the client. Each of these half-open connections is tracked in the TCP
connection table, eventually filling the table and blocking additional
connection attempts, legitimate or otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Memcached Amplification</em></p>
<p>An amplification attack is a type of reflection attack that takes
advantage of the ability to send small spoofed packets to services that,
as part of their normal operation, will reply back to the target with a
much larger response.</p>
<p>Memcached is a database caching system for speeding up websites and
networks. Attackers can spoof requests to a vulnerable internet-facing
memcached server, which then floods a target with traffic, potentially
overwhelming their resources. While the target’s infrastructure is
overloaded, new requests can’t be processed and regular traffic can’t
access the Internet resource, resulting in denial-of-service.</p>
<p>Other types of amplification attacks include NTP, SSDP, SNMPv2, CharGEN,
QOTD, and more.</p>
<p><em>UDP Flood</em></p>
<p>UDP is a standard communication protocol across IP networks. Because UDP
packets are stateless, they require less error checking and validation
in contrast to TCP. A UDP flood attack attempts to overload a server
with requests by saturating the connection tables on every accessible
server port.</p>
<p>Filling the connection table with these requests prevents legitimate
requests from being processed.</p>
<p><em>IP Fragmentation</em></p>
<p>IP fragmentation is a process established by design of the IP protocol
that breaks packets or datagrams into smaller fragments, so they can
pass through network links that have a smaller maximum transmission unit
(MTU) limit. The host or stateful security devices receiving the
fragments reassembles them into the original datagram. The packets’ or
datagrams’ IP header tells the receiver how to reassemble the datagram.</p>
<p>These attacks come in various forms, but all variations attempt to use
fragmentation to overwhelm the target server or network node.</p>
<p><strong>DNS Level DoS</strong></p>
<p><em>DNS Flood</em></p>
<p>DNS servers rely on the UDP protocol for name resolution, which (unlike
TCP queries) is connectionless. Because confirmation that UDP packets
have been received isn’t required, spoofing is easily accomplished.</p>
<p>This scripted botnet attack attempts to overwhelm server resources,
ultimately affecting the DNS servers’ ability to direct legitimate
requests. The attack can consist of valid UDP traffic from multiple
sources or randomized packet data. This helps this attack type evade
basic DDoS protection techniques like IP filtering.</p>
<p><em>NXDomain Flood</em></p>
<p>A variant of the DNS flood, an attacker floods the DNS server with
requests for invalid or nonexistent records. Then, the DNS server spends
its resources looking for something that doesn’t exist instead of
serving legitimate requests. The result is that the cache on the DNS
server gets filled with bad requests and clients can’t find the servers
they’re looking for.</p>
<p><em>DNS Amplification</em></p>
<p>DNS amplification is a type of reflection attack that manipulates
vulnerable internet facing DNS servers, causing them to flood an
internet resource with an influx of large UDP packets.</p>
<p>An attacker-controlled botnet is scripted to send small, but specially
formed, DNS queries to any publicly available DNS resolver. This elicits
a disproportionate response from the DNS resolver. The packet headers
also include a spoofed IP address, the IP address of the DDoS target.
Upon receiving the query, the open DNS resolvers provide an extremely
large response to the target of the attack, which eventually consumes
the bandwidth of the internet resource.</p>
<p><strong>TLS Level DoS</strong></p>
<p><em>SSL Renegotiation</em></p>
<p>This attack takes advantage of an asymmetric workload by requesting a
secure connection, and then continuously renegotiating it. This requires
a lot of CPU power from the server and can slow current or new
connections or even take down the server.</p>
<p><em>SSL Flood</em></p>
<p>Attackers send numerous TLS/SSL connection requests with the client
never closing the connection. Once the concurrent connection limit is
reached, the TLS termination point stops processing traffic, including
legitimate requests.</p>
<p><em>SSL Squeeze</em></p>
<p>A variant of an SSL renegotiation attack, the squeeze attack
continuously attempts to renegotiate the connection handshake, forcing
the server to decrypt “junk” requests.</p>
<p>Typical renegotiation attacks multiplex SSL handshakes, which can be
mitigated by disabling renegotiation on the server. However, SSL squeeze
opens new TCP connections for each request, eventually consuming I/O.</p>
<p><strong>Access Level DoS</strong></p>
<p><em>Brute-Force Login Attack</em></p>
<p>An attacker tries multiple username and password combinations, often
using a dictionary of words or commonly used passwords to gain
unauthorized access to an application or website.</p>
<p>A common mitigation is to temporarily lock out user accounts with
multiple failed login attempts. However, this can result in a denial of
service for those affected accounts.</p>
<p><strong>App Services Level DoS</strong></p>
<p><em>HTTP Flood</em></p>
<p>In an HTTP flood, the attacker exploits seemingly legitimate HTTP GET or
POST requests to attack a web server or application. These attacks
typically consume less bandwidth than others but focus on triggering
complex server-side processing to bring down the targeted site or app.
HTTP floods can sometimes trigger responses from web servers that can
turn it into a pipe-saturating volumetric attack.</p>
<p><em>Slowloris</em></p>
<p>Slowloris works by opening multiple connections to a web server and
sending HTTP requests, none of which are ever completed. Periodically,
the attacker sends subsequent HTTP headers for each request, but never
actually completes the request. Ultimately, the target server’s maximum
concurrent connection pool is filled and legitimate connections are
denied.</p>
<p><em>Heavy URL</em></p>
<p>During the reconnaissance phase, an attacker will map out the most
computationally expensive URLs on a site or application, also known as
heavy URLs. Heavy URLs include any URL causing greater server load upon
request. The initial HTTP request is relatively small but can take a
long time to complete or yield large response sizes. These requests can
require the server to load multiple large files or run
resource-intensive database queries.</p>
<p><em>Slow Post</em></p>
<p>An attacker begins by sending a legitimate HTTP POST request to a web
server, in which the header specifies the exact size of the message body
that will follow. However, that message body is then sent at an
extremely slow rate. Because the message is technically correct and
complete, the targeted server attempts to follow all specified rules. If
an attacker establishes enough of these POST attacks simultaneously,
they consume server resources to the extent legitimate requests are
denied.</p>

<p><strong>DNS / Global Load Balancer</strong></p>
<p>Global load balancing is used to gain performance and availability of
your global applications by sending users to the closest or
best-performing physical, virtual, or cloud environment.</p>
<p>BIG-IP DNS provides speed and security and can hyperscale up to 100
million responses per second (RPS) to manage rapid increases in DNS
queries. With a set of features that includes multicore scalability, DNS
Express, and IP Anycast integration, BIG-IP DNS handles millions of DNS
queries, protects your business from DDoS attacks, and ensures top
application performance for users.</p>
<p>BIG-IP DNS routes distributed app traffic to keep pace with changing
network and user volumes that can overwhelm data centers during peak
traffic times. BIG-IP DNS can also be configured as a full proxy for
global load balancing applications and DNS across architectures, as well
as across the globe.</p>
<p>BIG-IP DNS services integrate with DNS zone management solutions,
increase DNS performance at the network edge, and mask the DNS back-end
infrastructure. That translates into higher productivity, server
consolidation, faster responses, and protected DNS management</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/big-ip-advanced-firewall-manager-datasheet.pdf">https://www.f5.com/pdf/products/big-ip-advanced-firewall-manager-datasheet.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Firewall / Intrusion Prevention</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional firewalls, BIG-IP AFM is built on the full-proxy
architecture of the F5 TMOS operating system. Incoming client
connections are fully terminated, inspected for possible security
threats, and only then forwarded to the server—assuming no threats are
present.</p>
<p>With the full-proxy capabilities of TMOS, BIG-IP AFM has in-depth
understanding of the most commonly used inbound protocols such as
HTTP/S, DNS, ICMP, and TCP, and supports a rich set of services that
expand traditional stateful firewall capabilities. Additionally, this
security enables deeper visibility into connections, allowing data to be
manipulated and modified before it’s sent to servers or otherwise.</p>
<p>In the reverse direction, server-to-client communication is also
proxied. BIG-IP AFM can scrub return data for sensitive information—for
instance, protocol response codes that could divulge network information
for reconnaissance attacks—and private data, such as credit card or
Social Security numbers.</p>
<p>The full-proxy design enables termination of SSL, enforcement of
security policies, east-west firewall capabilities, and other
performance-related services—helping organizations address challenges in
volatility inside and outside of the data center.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of mapping applications to zones, or scouring through
spreadsheets of firewall policies to distinguish attacks on specific
applications or to identify the IP address for a particular application
server.</p>
<p>Unlike most network firewall solutions, BIG-IP AFM security policies are
logically aligned with the applications in specific traffic
flows—streamlining security operations and heightening security
effectiveness. But similar to web application firewall solutions,
BIG-AFM attaches network security policies to application objects.
Details about the application parameters, including server addressing,
SSL offload, and access policies, can be grouped together</p>
<p>with security parameters, including policies, SSL inspection, and
logging. This includes information on which layer 7 protocols are
permitted for specific application port access. F5’s app-centric
approach provides increased efficiency in addressing app concerns and
more accuracy in threat detection and policy effectiveness.</p>
<p>Further, since the configuration for an application is unified with an
associated network security policy, deprovisioning of applications is
also streamlined. When an application is deprovisioned, the obsolete
security rules are simultaneously deprovisioned. BIG-IP AFM helps ensure
the effectiveness of application deployment and simplifies policy
assurance above rigid zone-based or segment-based constructs.</p>

</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>SSL Visibility / Inspection / Analytics</strong></p>
<p>SSL/TLS enables businesses to securely communicate with customers and
partners. Problem is, SSL/TLS can also function as a tunnel that
attackers use to hide attacks and malware from security devices.
Inspection devices like a next-gen firewall, an IDS/IPS, or a malware
sandbox don’t see into encrypted SSL/TLS traffic or suffer degraded
performance when decrypting. F5 SSL Orchestrator easily integrates into
complex architectures and offers a centralized point for decryption and
re-encryption while strategically directing traffic to all the
appropriate inspection devices.</p>
<p>Managing the SSL/TLS connection between users and applications can be
tedious and leave room for security risks. F5 offers a solution to
centralize and simplify the management of keys, certificates, and
ciphers used in end-to-end encryption, so you can cost-effectively
protect data-in-transit by encrypting everything from the client to the
server. It also adheres to the FIPS 140-2 standard and scales to absorb
potentially crippling DDoS attacks. Use your solution to perform TLS
termination, TLS cipher policy enforcement, or TLS offload.</p>
<p>Attackers and security researchers are constantly trying to find new
ways to break today’s popular methods of encrypting data-in-transit.
Often, a flaw in the protocol design, a cipher, or an underlying library
is the culprit. Our solution provides for centralized management of your
TLS configuration which enables better application performance and
allows seamless flexibility in updating your TLS configurations as

<p><strong>Identity Access / Multi-factor Auth / Single Sign-On</strong></p>
<p>BIG-IP APM simplifies and consolidates your infrastructure. The
flexibility and scalability helps you to combine network access
controls, identity federation, SSO, and adaptive authentication into a
single application delivery solution.</p>
<p>Identity federation and single sign-on (SSO)</p>
<p>BIG-IP APM supports SSO and Kerberos ticketing across multiple domains,</p>
<p>enabling additional types of authentication, such as U.S. Federal
Government Common Access Cards (CACs) and the use of Active Directory
authentication for all applications.</p>
<p>Users are automatically signed on to back-end applications and services
that are part</p>
<p>of a Kerberos realm. This provides a seamless authentication flow after
a user has been authenticated through a supported user-authentication
mechanism. BIG-IP APM also delivers smart card support with credential
providers, so that users can connect their devices to the network before
signing in.</p>
<p>BIG-IP APM simplifies mobile access to protected resources by enabling
remote access (VPN) authentication and authorization from Microsoft
Windows, Apple Mac OS, Apple iOS, and Google Android devices—as well as
devices running Chrome OS via SAML (such</p>
<p>as Google Chromebooks). SAML-based authentication increases security,
reduces user dependencies on passwords, and improves both the user
experience and productivity.</p>
<p>SAML 2.0 further enhances BIG-IP APM identity federation and SSO options
by supporting connections initiated by both SAML identity providers
(IdPs) and service providers.</p>
<p>This functionality extends identity federation, as well as SSO
capabilities to cloud-based applications and offers identity federation
across an organization’s BIG-IP products. It also empowers
administrators to centrally disable user access to all identity-enabled
applications, regardless of where they reside, saving time and boosting
administrative productivity.</p>
<p>BIG-IP APM can serve as a translator, enabling SSO via SAML to
applications that support SAML, as well as to those that are not
SAML-enabled. For applications that do not accept SAML, BIG-IP APM can
convert the authentication access to the appropriate authentication for
that application. This ensures users can utilize SSO to
applications—regardless of whether these apps support SAML, are
on-premises, or in the cloud.</p>
<p>BIG-IP APM secures the transport of SAML messages by supporting SAML
artifact binding, reducing the flow of SAML messages through browsers,
addressing certain browser restrictions, and extending identity
federation and SSO support to automatically submitted forms that do not
support JavaScript. BIG-IP APM also extends identity federation via SAML
to client-based applications and other browserless
environments—including desktop applications and server code in web
apps—and streamlines user workflow by supporting SAML Enhanced Client or
Proxy (ECP) profiles.</p>
<p>BIG-IP APM supports the OAuth 2.0 open-standard for authorization. It
can serve as a client for social networking logins, as an authorization
delegate for SaaS applications, and can enhance protection for and
authorization of application programmable interfaces (APIs)</p>
<p>for web services.</p>
<p>By delivering seamless user access to web applications in a highly
available and heterogeneous environment, BIG-IP APM improves business
continuity and saves your organization from decreased user productivity.
BIG-IP APM supports and integrates with AAA servers and user credential
stores—including Active Directory, Lightweight Directory Access
Protocols (LDAP), RADIUS, and Native RSA SecurID—and delivers high
availability through the intelligent traffic management capabilities of
BIG-IP LTM.</p>
<p>In addition, BIG-IP APM recognizes when an RSA SecurID software token is
installed on a user’s Windows or Mac device, prompting the user for an
RSA PIN and seamlessly authenticating that user. BIG-IP APM also
supports Google reCAPTCHA V2 for authentication and contextual
authentication.</p>

<p><strong>Web Application Firewall</strong></p>
<p>A web application firewall (WAF) is a special type of application
firewall that applies specifically to web applications. It is deployed
in front of web applications and analyzes bi-directional web-based
(HTTP) traffic - detecting and blocking anything malicious. The OWASP
provides a broad technical definition for a WAF as “a security solution
on the web application level which - from a technical point of view -
does not depend on the application itself.” According to the PCI DSS
Information Supplement for requirement 6.6, a WAF is defined as “a
security policy enforcement point positioned between a web application
and the client endpoint. This functionality can be implemented in
software or hardware, running in an appliance device, or in a typical
server running a common operating system. It may be a stand-alone device
or integrated into other network components.” In other words, a WAF can
be a virtual or physical appliance that prevents vulnerabilities in web
applications from being exploited by outside threats. These
vulnerabilities may be because the application itself is a legacy type
or it was insufficiently coded by design. The WAF addresses these code
shortcomings by special configurations of rule-sets, also known as
policies.</p>

<p><em>Return on Investment (ROI)</em></p>
<p>As companies purchase infrastructure such as F5 BIG-IP platforms to
handle all of their application services needs, they will weigh the
costs of that infrastructure against the benefits that it provides. This
measuring results in Return On Investment (ROI). Effective organizations
have a positive Return on Investment, or ROI, for individual technology
choices as well as their overall investment in technology.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation">*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depreciation*</a></p>
<p><em>Depreciation</em></p>
<p>Hardware assets like BIG-IP appliances can be depreciated over time.
Depreciation is a method of reallocating the cost of a tangible asset
over its useful life span of it being in motion. Businesses depreciate
long-term assets for both accounting and tax purposes. The former
affects the balance sheet of a business or entity, and the latter
affects the net income that they report. Generally, the cost is
allocated, as depreciation expense, among the periods in which the asset
is expected to be used.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure">*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure*</a></p>
<p><em>CapEx (Capital Expenditure)</em></p>
<p>In short, it is the money a company spends to buy, maintain, or improve
its fixed assets, such as buildings, vehicles, equipment, or land. For
tax purposes, capex is a cost that cannot be deducted in the year in
which it is paid or incurred and must be capitalized. This is the driver
that motivates most companies to try to reduce CapEx and increase OpEx.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense">*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense*</a></p>
<p><em>OpEx (Operating Expense)</em></p>
<p>This is ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system. Its
counterpart, a capital expenditure (capex), is the cost of developing or
providing non-consumable parts for the product or system. In business,
an operating expense is a day-to-day expense such as sales and
administration, or research &amp; development, as opposed to production,
costs, and pricing. In short, this is the money the business spends in
order to turn inventory into throughput.</p>
<p>If the company is sensitive to CapEx expenditures, then putting BIG-IPs
into the operating budget may be preferable. BIG-IP VEs licensed under
an Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) or Subscription licensing
agreement.</p>

<p><em>Payment delivery timeframe</em></p>
<p>Businesses, regardless of the industry or size, require regular cash
flow from their clients and the customer to pay their expenses, such as
their employees’ salaries and the utilities. That’s why invoicing is a
necessity. Without these bills, you won’t be compensated for the
services rendered or products sold, which in turn means that you won’t
be able to handle your expenses.</p>

<p><strong>Sizing BIG-IP</strong></p>
<p>The platform and virtual editions datasheets will give you general
performance numbers. You should refer to the datasheets as you make
general sizing determinations. In most cases, these are the maximum
capabilities at which either CPU or memory is completely consumed. This
means determining CPU and memory requirements are extremely important in
determining the appliance or virtual edition that is purchase for a
solution. For, example, the amount of memory not only determines how
many modules can run on a BIG-IP, but also how many concurrent
connections can be maintained, as each current connection uses a finite
amount of memory. CPU can be a limiting factor, HTTP compression
consumers CPU, if not performed in hardware, SSL can consume CPU
depending on the key size, cipher and whether the cipher is supported by
hardware and for BIG-IP Virtual Editions this is always the case.</p>
<p>Often, CPU utilization and performance can be the key to determining
whether appliances are needed as opposed to virtual editions. Offloading
to hardware, functionality, as simple L4 operations to the ePVA, SSL key
exchange to the Cavium/Intel SSL chip or compression chip will save both
CPU and memory.</p>
<p>Some question you may want to ponder;</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do I have enough CPUs and what kind of utilization should it expect?<ul>
<li>vCMP guest, multiple modules, complex or simple policies, iRules,
analytics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Am I leaving enough room for 3-5 years of growth?<ul>
<li>OpEx vs CapEx</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Memory requirements?<ul>
<li>vCMP guest, concurrent connections, HTTP caching is done strictly
using memory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What will SSL TPS look like?<ul>
<li>What ciphers will be used, what is the key size, how many SSL key
exchanges will need to be built per second on both the client and
server side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concurrent connections?</li>
<li>Connections/Sec?<ul>
<li>How many new connections per second need to be build.</li>
<li>How much memory per connection is consumed (content spooling)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Config size?<ul>
<li>What is the size on the overall configuration of the BIG-IP, do
you need to allocate more memory to the control plane?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is the control plane overwhelmed?</li>
<li>Are there multiple modules?</li>
<li>Where can I accelerate/optimize?</li>
</ul>
<p>Module Memory Requirements</p>
<p>Memory requirements in the release notes are solely for&nbsp;provisioning.
They aren’t a substitute for sizing resources appropriately. When
combining multiple software modules, you should typically size for
the&nbsp;worst-case (heavy hitter) module and then adjust for running
multiple modules. Each module will consume memory and CPU resources, so
it’s better&nbsp;to oversize for multiple module use cases. BIG-IP ASM and
BIG-IP APM are examples of resource-intensive&nbsp;modules.</p>
<p>How much memory does a connection take</p>
<p>It depends! Layer 4 state uses much less memory than layer 7. Basic rule
of thumb is ~750k L4 connections per 1 GB of memory. Basic rule of thumb
is 100-130k L7 connections per 1 GB of memory (~6X more memory than L4).
Basic rule of thumb is 50-170k SSL connections per 1 GB of memory. These
numbers are all for basic BIG-LTM functionality. Memory per connection
may increase if other advanced services such as BIG-IP ASM, BIG-IP APM,
and iRules are enabled.</p>
<p>CPU</p>
<p>CPU speed can be an important sizing metric when there are a lot of
CPU-intensive tasks running. It can also be combatted by throwing more
CPU cores at the problem, even if they are running at a slower speed.
Think about what type of processing the sizing for (L7 processing,
iRules, BIG-IP ASM, SSL ciphers that require software processing,
Monitors, Control plane).</p>
<p>Web Application Firewall performance depends on a number of parameters,
such as (Response size, Request size, Application/server response
latency, Policys in use, Number of simultaneous connections, Logging
profile, SSL key length in use). All of which are highly dependent on
the applications and how it operates.</p>
<p>Sizing BIG-IP Summary</p>
<p>While throughput and connections per second are important metrics, they
are not the only things that should be considered when sizing BIG-IP.
Memory and CPU are just as important if not more important than some of
the datasheet numbers. Plan for growth in any sizing exercise. You never
know what resources you’ll need a couple of years down the road. Ensure
you plan for the lifetime of the projected install.</p>

<p><strong>Distinguishing F5 from Competition</strong></p>
<p>Most of the time it is best as a customer’s trusted advisor to not
attack F5’s competition and try to make claims on what they can’t do. It
is always a better approach to explain how we can effectively solve the
problems or issues they are facing. F5 has a large repository of documentation on our
product capabilities. But there are a few generalized documents that
will help you with competitive differentiation and customer objection
handling. If you must have specific documentation that relates to F5’s
capabilities as opposed to one of our competitor’s, you should work with
the F5 sales team on the account and let them find the necessary
information.</p>
