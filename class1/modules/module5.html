<p><strong>5.01 - Explain when a hardware based application deliver platform
solution is appropriate and when a virtual machine solution is
appropriate</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hardware vs. Software</strong></p>
<p>Different situations call for the BIG-IP Virtual Edition and the
physical BIG-IP hardware.</p>
<p>The Virtual Edition should be used for discrete workloads on commodity
hardware. It also provides flexible and quick deployment options and
failure isolation. Virtual Editions can also give you the flexibility to
run in proprietary computing environments like Amazon Web Services (AWS)
and other public cloud offerings.</p>
<p>Physical hardware provides a number of important benefits and is
necessary in many situations. F5 hardware is purposefully built to
provide high performance for application delivery. Using an F5 physical
platform also offers a single-vendor solution. If a customer is running
an F5 Virtual Edition on an HP server and an issue arises,
troubleshooting between vendors is more difficult. When F5 hardware runs
F5 software, this is avoided.</p>
<p>Additionally, a BIG-IP physical device can run all BIG-IP modules and
perform hardware SSL offload and compression. It provides customers with
all other features that may be important to their deployment, such as
always-on management, certifications, special-purpose FPGAs, and
improved security.</p>

<p><strong>5.01 - Explain the purpose, advantages, and challenges associated with
hardware based application deliver platform solutions</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.f5.com/pdf/products/big-ip-platforms-datasheet.pdf">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<p>BIG-IP ADC appliances can help you simplify your network by offloading
servers and consolidating devices, saving management costs as well as
power, space, and cooling in the data center.</p>
<p>With the massive performance and scalability of the BIG-IP platform, you
can reduce the number of Application Delivery Controllers you need to
deliver even the most demanding applications. By offloading
computationally intense processes, you can significantly reduce the
number of application servers needed.</p>
<p>BIG-IP hardware includes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SSL hardware accelerationâOffload costly SSL processing and
accelerate key exchange and bulk encryption with best-in-market SSL
performance.</li>
<li>Hardware compression*âCost-effectively offload traffic compression
processing from your servers to improve page load times and reduce
bandwidth utilization.</li>
<li>OneConnect connection poolingâAggregate millions of TCP requests into
hundreds of server-side connections. Increase server capacity and
ensure requests are handled efficiently.</li>
<li>Embedded Packet Velocity Acceleration (ePVA)*âProvide specific
application delivery optimizations, support for low latency and
tunneling protocols, and denial-of-service (DoS) protection. ePVA
uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology tightly
integrated with TMOS and software to deliver:</li>
<li>High performance interconnects between Ethernet ports and processors.</li>
<li>L4 offload, enabling leading throughput and reduced load on software.</li>
<li>Hardware-accelerated SYN flood protection.</li>
<li>More than 65 types of DoS attacks detected and mitigated in hardware.</li>
<li>Native Financial Information eXchange (FIX) support for message
routing and tag substitution while maintaining low latency
requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<p>The Advantages of F5 BIG-IP Technology</p>
<p>Unique architecture and patented hardware and software innovations from
F5 offer unmatched capabilities, including:</p>
<p>F5 ScaleN architecture</p>
<p>ScaleN enables you to scale performance on demand, virtualize, or
horizontally cluster multiple BIG-IP devices, creating an elastic
Application Delivery Networking infrastructure that can efficiently
adapt as your business needs change.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On-demand scalingâIncrease capacity and performance with on-demand
scaling, where you can simply add more power to your existing
infrastructure instead of adding more devices. The latest BIG-IP
appliance models can be upgraded to the higher performance model
within each series through on-demand software licensing. On- demand
licensing enables organizations to right-size application delivery
services and support growth without requiring new hardware.</li>
<li>Operational scalingâF5 can virtualize ADC services with a
multi-tenant architecture that supports a variety of BIG-IP versions
and product modules on a single device. Multi- tenant device
virtualization is provided by F5âs unique Virtual Clustered
Multiprocessing (vCMP) technology, which enables select hardware
platforms to run multiple BIG-IP guest instances. Each BIG-IP guest
instance looks and acts like a physical BIG-IP device, with a
dedicated allocation of CPU, memory, and other resources.<ul>
<li>You can further divide each vCMP guest using multi-tenant features such as partitions and route domains, which can isolate configuration and networks on a per-virtual-domain basis. Within each virtual domain, you can further isolate and secure configuration and policies by using a role-based access system for greater administrative control. When combining both route domains/partitions with vCMP guests, F5 provides the highest density multi-tenant virtualization solution that can scale to thousands of virtual ADC (vADC) instances.</li>
<li>This ability to virtualize BIG-IP ADC services means service providers and enterprise users can isolate based on BIG-IP version, enabling departmental or project-based tenancy as well as performance guarantees, while benefiting from managing a single, consolidated application delivery platform and increased utilization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application scalingâIncrease capacity by adding BIG-IP resources
through an all-active approach. With application scaling, you can
scale beyond the traditional device pair to eliminate the need for
idle and costly standby resources. Application scaling achieves this
through two forms of horizontal scale: Application Service
Clustering, which focuses on application scalability and high
availability, and Device Service Clustering, designed to efficiently
and seamlessly scale BIG-IP application delivery services.<ul>
<li>Application Service Clustering delivers sub-second failover and comprehensive connection mirroring for a highly available cluster of up to eight devices at the application layer, providing highly available multi-tenant deployments. Workloads can be moved across a cluster of devices or virtual instances without interrupting other services and can be scaled to meet the business demand.</li>
<li>Device Service Clustering can synchronize full device configurations in an all-active deployment model, enabling consistent policy deployment and enforcement across devicesâup to 32 active nodes. This ensures a consistent device configuration that simplifies operations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Some of the only challenges with hardware are that it can take longer to
acquire for implementations, which can add to time lines in projects,
and some public cloud environments do not let you run your own hardware,
since it is a strictly virtualized environment.</p>

<p><strong>5.01 - Explain the purpose, advantages, and challenges associated with virtual machines</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.f5.com">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Virtual Hardware</strong></p>
<p>Virtualization is critical to maintaining an adaptable network and
accomplishing the scale, consolidation, and business continuity demanded
by todayâs advanced application infrastructures.</p>
<p>F5 BIG-IP virtual editions (VEs) are virtual application delivery
controllers (vADCs) that can be deployed on all leading hypervisors and
cloud platforms running on commodity servers. BIG-IP VEs deliver all the
same market-leading Software-Defined Application Services
(SDAS)âincluding advanced traffic management, acceleration, DNS,
firewall, and access managementâthat run on F5 purpose-built hardware.
VE software images are downloadable and portable between on-premises
virtualized data centers, public, and hybrid cloud environments. With
BIG-IP virtual editions and F5 BIG-IQ management solutions, you can
rapidly provision consistent application services across the data center
and into the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
<p>Deploy with increased agility</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Quickly and easily spin up, spin down, or migrate application
delivery services in and across the data center and public cloud,
using instant deployment options as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Achieve automation and orchestration in cloud architectures</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Automate deployment and configuration or integrate with leading
orchestration frameworksâin cloud or software-defined networking
(SDN) environments through application level templates, REST APIs,
and granular programmability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Optimize application services more efficiently</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rapidly provision and consolidate application services on your
existing servers, unlocking the broadest feature density through
flexible licensing models that align to your business needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide the ultimate in flexibility</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get the most flexible deployment options in the industry, with
support across all major virtualization platforms for both private
and public cloud environments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Some of the only challenges with have to do with performance when
compared to what dedicated hardware can do. Throughput speeds and
volumetric processing of SSL transactions per second does not compare
with anything above a 4000 series in hardware.</p>

<p><strong>5.02 - Describe the purpose of TCP optimization</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.f5.com/pdf/analyst-reports/acceleration-101-wp.pdf">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Optimizing TCP</strong></p>
<p>Although TCP is ubiquitous today, the protocol has undergone many
updates to help overcome limitations that existed in earlier versions.
An acceleration device can help optimize TCP by implementing features
that may not be present in either a client or serverâs TCP
implementation.</p>
<p>An acceleration device can also decrease the number of server-side TCP
connections required to service client requests. Additionally, it can
help accelerate HTTP traffic by increasing the number of simultaneous
client-side TCP connections a browser can open while downloading a web
page.</p>
<p><strong>General TCP Optimizations</strong></p>
<p>Because it operates as a proxy, an acceleration device may be able to
implement features missing from a client or server that can help speed
application delivery. The acceleration device may be able to leverage
optimizations natively supported by particular client or server
operating systems and is likely to be able to implement optimizations
that are not operating-system specific. The benefit of high speed, high
latency WAN connections are that the acceleration device can perform TCP
window scaling to improve performance. To overcome packet loss, the
acceleration device can implement selective TCP acknowledgements (SACK)
and advanced congestion control algorithms to prevent TCP from reducing
throughput.</p>
<p>These are only two examples. Some acceleration devices implement
hundreds of improvements to TCP in order to help it perform better.</p>
<p><strong>Decreasing Server-side TCP Connections</strong></p>
<p>Reducing server-side connection processing can dramatically improve
application performance and reduce the number of servers required to
host an application. TCP connection setup and teardown requires
significant overhead, particularly for servers. As the number of open
server connections increases, maintaining the open connections while
simultaneously opening new connections can severely degrade server
performance and therefore, user response time.</p>
<p>Although multiple transactions (for example, file transfers) can occur
within a single TCP connection, a connection is generally between one
client and one server. Normally, a connection closes either when a
server reaches a defined transaction limit or when a client has
transferred all needed files from that server. Because an acceleration
device operates as a proxy, it can aggregate, or âpool,â TCP server-side
connections by combining many separate transactions, potentially from
many users, through fewer (or one) TCP connections. The acceleration
device opens new server-side connections only when necessary, and
instead reuses existing connections for requests from other users
whenever possible.</p>
<p><strong>Increasing Client-side TCP Connections</strong></p>
<p>By default, most web browsers limit the maximum number of simultaneous
HTTP/HTTPS connections that the browser can open to one URL. For
example, Microsoft Internet Explorer v7 and below limit the maximum
number of simultaneous connections to two per domain. Earlier versions
of Firefox limit the browser to eight connections per domain. Given that
a web page can contain dozens of objects, this limitation can greatly
slow page-loading times.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a user running Internet Explorer v7 requests a page
from a web server that returns a response containing a list of the 30
objects that make up the web page. Further assume that that all objects
are accessed through the domain, www.example.com. The browser opens two
connections to www.example.com, requests one object at a time per
connection (the limit imposed by TCP), and then reuses the two
connections until all files have been downloaded or the connection
reaches the serverâs transaction limit. If the connection suffers high
latency, round trip time is high and download speed can be greatly
reduced.</p>
<p>If the server terminates the connection after reaching a pre-defined
transaction limit, the browser opens another connection to that URL.
This process continues until the page downloads completely. Operating
this way needlessly increases the page load time.</p>
<p>Some acceleration devices can âspoofâ a browser by modifying the URLs in
an HTTP response to speed page downloading. The modified URLs must first
be defined in DNS to point to the same IP address. When examining the
server response, the modified names appear to the browser to be
different servers, so the web browser opens parallel connections to
these altered URLs rather than serially downloading the objects from one
URL.</p>

<p><strong>5.02 - Describe the purpose of HTTP Keep-alives, caching, compression, and pipelining</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.f5.com/pdf/analyst-reports/acceleration-101-wp.pdf">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>HTTP Protocol and Web Application Optimizations</strong></p>
<p>HTTP protocol optimizations maintain high user performance levels by
optimally tuning each HTTP session. For example, some web applications
are unable to return an HTTP 304 status code (Not Modified) in response
to a client request rather than returning the entire object. Because an
acceleration device proxies connections and caches content, it may be
able to note when there is no change to a requested object and return
the 304 response instead. This enables the browser to load the content
from its own cache, even in conditions where the web application is
hard-coded to re-send the object.</p>
<p>Some acceleration devices can additionally examine and change server
responses to provide better browser and server performance. For example,
some off-the-shelf and custom applications add a no-cache header to some
objects, which directs a browser not to cache an object, rather to
download the object from the origin web server every time. The purpose
of the no-cache header is to ensure a browser always downloads dynamic
(changing) data.</p>
<p>However, applications in some cases mark static data like a company logo
as being non-cacheable. Some acceleration devices can re-write the
server response to mark the object as being cacheable and supply a more
realistic expiration date. This feature can help remedy problems with
off-the-shelf or custom-developed applications where code cannot easily
be modified.</p>
<p><strong>Caching</strong></p>
<p>Caching involves storing data close to users and re-using the data
during subsequent requests. Caching usually takes one of three forms.
The first is the classic approach taken by web browsers and web
applications. In this case, the web application code running on a server
instructs a browser to cache an object marked as static for a specific
time period. During that time period, the browser reads the object from
cache when building a web page until the content expires. The client
then reloads the content. Caching prevents the browser from having to
waste time and bandwidth by always accessing data from a central site.
This is the most common form of caching in use today.</p>
<p>The second form involves deploying an acceleration device in a data
center to offload requests for web application content from web servers.
This method operates asymmetrically, with the acceleration device
caching objects from web servers and delivering them directly to users.
Some acceleration devices cache static content only, while some
additionally can process HTTP responses, include objects referenced in a
response, and send the included objects as a single object to a browser.
This not only offloads web server processing but also offloads web
browser processing too. A side benefit to this approach is that as the
acceleration device is typically in the data center and connected to
higher-speed connections, the acceleration device can both assemble the
objects from instructions in the HTTP response and deliver them using
fewer objects and with fewer transactions.</p>
<p>Operating in this manner, caching can dramatically reduce server TCP and
application processing, improve web page loading time, and hence reduce
the need to regularly expand the number of web servers required to
service an application.</p>
<p>The third form of caching involves using symmetric acceleration devices
to cache and serve content to users at the remote site. The remote
acceleration device serves content locally whenever possible, which
reduces both response time and network utilization. This form of caching
can be deployed not only for HTTP, but also for other protocols as well.</p>
<p>Caching has its limitations. First, if the client-side acceleration
device serves content regardless of whether it is in contact with its
remote peer, the client side device must implement access control to
prevent unauthorized access to an object. Second, the client-side device
may serve older, stale versions of content that change after the
connection between the devices is broken. While this typically is not an
issue with static web content, it can have significant impact on files
that regularly change. When both issues are addressed, remote caching
can greatly improve application performance, especially for web
applications and static files used with other applications.</p>
<p><strong>Compression</strong></p>
<p>Compression is one of the oldest acceleration techniques, having been
around for decades. GZIP, the most common compression algorithm, is
implemented in virtually every web browser and server. Compression
algorithms such as GZIP are good at finding small, repeating patterns
and reducing the characters required to send them. Besides web servers
and browsers, acceleration devices implement compression. This is done
for two reasons: first to offload compression overhead from web servers
and second, to enable the acceleration device to perform other
optimizations that improve performance for an HTTP/HTTPS stream.</p>
<p>Compression can be computationally expensive, especially for algorithms
that provide high compression levels. These algorithms are of limited
use with high-speed communication, where delays must be minimized to
maintain rapid user response times. More effective compression
algorithms are therefore limited to low- speed communications where more
time is available to perform compression processing without degrading
user throughput and hence, response times. Fortunately, compression
hardware assist is now available in some acceleration devices that can
achieve compression rates in excess of 1 Gbps.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://devcentral.f5.com/Portals/0/Cache/Pdfs/2807/http-pipelining-a-security-risk-without-real-performance-benefits.pdf">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Pipelining</strong></p>
<p>Everyone wants web sites and applications to load faster, and thereâs no
shortage of folks out there looking for ways to do just that. But all
that glitters are not gold and not all acceleration techniques actually
do all that much to accelerate the delivery of web sites and
applications. Worse, some actual incur risk in the form of leaving
servers open to exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>A brief history</strong></p>
<p>Back in the day when HTTP was still evolving, someone came up with the
concept of persistent connections. See, in ancient times - when
administrators still wore togas in the data center - HTTP 1.0 required
one TCP connection for every object on a page. That was okay, until
pages started comprising ten, twenty, and more objects. So someone added
an HTTP header, Keep-Alive, which basically told the server not to close
the TCP connection until (a) the browser told it to or (b) it didnât
hear from the browser for X number of seconds (a time out). This
eventually became the default behavior when HTTP 1.1 was written and
became a standard.</p>
<p><strong>I told you it was a brief history.</strong></p>
<p>This capability is known as a persistent connection, because the
connection persists across multiple requests. This is not the same as
pipelining, though the two are closely related. Pipelining takes the
concept of persistent connections and then ignores the traditional
request - reply relationship inherent in HTTP and throws it out the
window.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/1p33.png" src="../../_images/1p33.png" />
<p>The general line of thought goes like this:</p>
<p>âWhoa. What if we just shoved all the requests from a page at the server
and then waited for them all to come back rather than doing it one at a
time? We could make things even faster!â</p>
<p><strong>HTTP pipelining</strong></p>
<p>In technical terms, the browser initiates HTTP pipelining by opening a
connection to the server and then sending multiple requests to the
server without waiting for a response. Once the requests are all sent
then the browser starts listening for responses. The reason this is
considered an acceleration technique is that by shoving all the requests
at the server at once you essentially save the RTT (Round Trip Time) on
the connection waiting for a response after each request is sent.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/1p34.png" src="../../_images/1p34.png" />
<p><strong>Why it just doesnât matter anymore (and maybe never did)</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, pipelining was conceived of and implemented before
broadband connections were widely utilized as a method of accessing the
Internet. Back then, the RTT was significant enough to have a negative
impact on application and web site performance and the overall
user-experience was improved by the use of pipelining. Today, however,
most folks have a comfortable speed at which they access the Internet
and the RTT impact on most web applicationâs performance, despite the
increasing number of objects per page, is relatively low.</p>
<p>There is no arguing, however, that some reduction in time to load is
better than none. Too, anyone whoâs had to access the Internet via high
latency links can tell you anything that makes that experience faster
has got to be a Good Thing. So whatâs the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is that pipelining isnât actually treated any differently on
the server than regular old persistent connections. In fact, the HTTP
1.1 specification requires that a âserver MUST send its responses to
those requests in the same order that the requests were received.â In
other words, the requests are return in serial, despite the fact that
some web servers may actually process those requests in parallel.
Because the server MUST return responses to requests in order that the
server has to do some extra processing to ensure compliance with this
part of the HTTP 1.1 specification. It has to queue up the responses and
make certain responses are returned properly, which essentially negates
the performance gained by reducing the number of round trips using
pipelining.</p>
<p>Depending on the order in which requests are sent, if a request
requiring particularly lengthy processing - say a database query - were
sent relatively early in the pipeline, this could actually cause a
degradation in performance because all the other responses have to wait
for the lengthy one to finish before the others can be sent back.</p>
<p>Application intermediaries such as proxies, application delivery
controllers, and general load-balancers can and do support pipelining,
but they, too, will adhere to the protocol specification and return
responses in the proper order according to how the requests were
received. This limitation on the server side actually inhibits a
potentially significant boost in performance because we know that
processing dynamic requests takes longer than processing a request for
static content. If this limitation were removed it is possible that the
server would become more efficient and the user would experience
non-trivial improvements in performance. Or, if intermediaries were
smart enough to rearrange requests such a way that their execution were
optimized then weâd maintain the performance benefits gained by
pipelining. But that would require an understanding of the application
that goes far beyond what even todayâs most intelligent application
delivery controllers are capable of providing.</p>
<p><strong>The silver lining</strong></p>
<p>At this point it may be fairly disappointing to learn that HTTP
pipelining today does not result in as significant a performance gain as
it might at first seem to offer (except over high latency links like
satellite or dial-up, which are rapidly dwindling in usage). But that
may very well be a good thing.</p>
<p>As miscreants have become smarter and more intelligent about exploiting
protocols and not just application code, theyâve learned to take
advantage of the protocol to âtrickâ servers into believing their
requests are legitimate, even though the desired result is usually
malicious. In the case of pipelining, it would be a simple thing to
exploit the capability to enact a layer 7 DoS attack on the server in
question. Because pipelining assumes that requests will be sent one
after the other and that the client is not waiting for the response
until the end, it would have a difficult time distinguishing between
someone attempting to consume resources and a legitimate request.</p>
<p>Consider that the server has no understanding of a âpageâ. It
understands individual requests. It has no way of knowing that a âpageâ
consists of only 50 objects, and therefore a client pipelining requests
for the maximum allowed - by default 100 for Apache - may not be seen as
out of the ordinary. Several clients opening connections and pipelining
hundreds or thousands of requests every second without caring if they
receive any of the responses could quickly consume the serverâs
resources or available bandwidth and result in a denial of service to
legitimate users.</p>
<p>So perhaps the fact that pipelining is not really all that useful to
most folks is a good thing, as server administrators can disable the
feature without too much concern and thereby mitigate the risk of the
feature being leveraged as an attack method against them.</p>
<p>Pipelining as it is specified and implemented today is more of a
security risk than it is a performance enhancement. There are, however,
tweaks to the specification that could be made in the future that might
make it more useful. Those tweaks do not address the potential security
risk, however, so perhaps given that there are so many other
optimizations and acceleration techniques that can be used to improve
performance that incur no measurable security risk that we simply let
sleeping dogs lie.</p>
