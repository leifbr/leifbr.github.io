<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Positive_security_model">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Positive Security Model</strong></p>
<p>A “positive” security model (also known as “whitelist”) is one that
defines what is allowed, and rejects everything else.</p>
<p>The positive security model can be applied to a number of different
application security areas. For example, when performing input
validation, the positive model dictates that you should specify the
characteristics of input that will be allowed, as opposed to trying to
filter out bad input. In the access control area, the positive model is
to deny access to everything, and only allow access to specific
authorized resources or functions. If you’ve ever had to deal with a
network firewall, then you’ve probably encountered this application of
the positive model.</p>

<p><strong>4.01 - Describe the concept of a negative security model</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.xiom.com/waf-negative-model">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Negative Security Model</strong></p>
<p>A “negative” (or “blacklist”) security model is one that defines what is
disallowed, while implicitly allowing everything else.</p>
<p>A negative security model (or misuse based detection) is based on a set
of rules that detect attacks rather than allow only valid traffic.</p>
<p>A negative security model is very common to Intrusion Detection and
Prevention systems (IDPS). Therefore it is very important to understand
what the differences are between the negative security model provided by
an IDPS and the negative security model provided by a WAF.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of a Positive Security Model</strong></p>
<p>The benefit of using a positive model is that 0-day attacks, will be
prevented as well as developer related shortcomings. However, the
positive model is susceptible to false positives in that if you don’t
account for everything that the application needs to function in the
policy you will block it. Also if the application changes you will need
to build a new custom policy to match the new changes.</p>

<p><strong>Benefits of a Negative Security Model</strong></p>
<p>The benefit of a negative security model is that it can be deployed
rapidly. You do not have to worry with building a complicated policy
that has to deal with every transactional function of the application.
You are simply blocking any known bad attacks that could happen. You are
vulnerable to 0-day attacks of which the pattern of the attack is not
already known.</p>

<p><strong>4.01 - Security (Non-Blueprint)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://f5.com/resources/white-papers/applied-application-security-positive-and-negative">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Positive &amp; Negative Security model</strong></p>
<p>After many years of purely negative security provided by anti-virus
scanners, IDS/IPS, and antispam engines, it’s refreshing to hear that
the positive security model—the basis for tried and true security
devices like network firewalls and ACLs—is coming back in vogue. Most
recently, this positive policy re-emergence has revolved around the Web
Application Firewall (WAF) and application security market. Yet with the
positive security positioning comeback carries with it a very
interesting point of detail: although many in the WAF space argue that
the positive model is preferable, nearly all application security
providers still rely on a partially negative solution. While
acknowledging that a positive security model is the preferable model to
secure web applications, many practitioners and vendors advocate a
bilateral approach of both positive and negative security.</p>
<p>As the application security market continues to evolve and define
itself, there continues to be diverging views on which security
methodology is the best option. In reality, enterprise security
decisions are highly dependent on many factors, most of which are more
business than technology oriented. Implementing an application security
solution that is both secure and practical—while still allowing for the
fluid nature of protecting dynamic applications—requires taking the best
pieces of technology and business analysis and synthesizing them into an
effective and efficient security solution.</p>
<p><strong>What Does “Good” Security Cost?</strong></p>
<p>In theory, the best security is impenetrable, but practical security
does not function as a control group. In a business environment,
security is a multivariate problem. What is the performance of the
security? How easy is it to deploy? What impact will adding security
have on the cost per transaction? Is it more expensive to build an
impenetrable security system or risk covering the cost of a public
breach? The quality of the security is always questioned as well, but
it’s never the only question. Many security-related questions come from
the balance sheets, not the security engineers. Approaching security
from a technical standpoint alone does not help the business; it hurts
it.</p>
<p>Businesses constantly analyze their economic model to generate better
operational efficiencies and a greater return on investment; the entire
business intelligence market exists for this purpose. The driving force
behind any IT security decision is an evaluation of a situation’s
potential risks versus the investment necessary to circumvent these
risks. In the same vein, a business’ security efforts should address a
business problem; namely, to increase operational efficiencies. Security
breaches can mar this efficiency, hurting a company’s value, either in
real dollars, operational downtime, or loss of customer trust. In truth,
the motivation behind every IT decision (including security decisions)
is a business decision. This has been stated and fully advocated by
Gartner as well:</p>
<p>Jay Heiser, a Gartner vice president, said the fundamental problem with
a purely technical approach is that IT security professionals have no
understanding of business. Speaking at [the] Gartner IT Security Summit
in London, Heiser said businesses must now mature and appoint
individuals who understand the complexities of business, rather than the
simplicities of security.</p>
<p>When IT decisions become business decisions, blurring the distinction
between secure value and business value, theoretical security and
applied, or practical, security begin to separate. The theoretical
approach places security on a singular plane, untouched by other
business factors; applied security is comprised of the measure and level
of actual security safeguards and implementations needed to accomplish
business goals.</p>
<p>For a security product to be a functional part of a business’ IT
infrastructure, the product’s applied security must be given more
attention than the product’s theoretical security. A solution that only
strives to provide ultimate security will almost always be replaced with
a solution designed to apply “good enough” security and increase
business efficiencies than one intending to recreate Fort Knox.
Theoretical security is a checkbox criteria, applied security becomes
more of a buy-and-use criteria. Applied security exists at an
equilibrium point between total security (theoretical security) and
total functionality (no security). The choice between these two—and what
to sacrifice—is made based on the most operationally efficient method
for achieving that prescribed balance. To better evaluate the root ROI
question when dealing with security products, the next logical question
becomes “Which model, positive or negative, provides this equilibrium in
the most operationally efficient manner?</p>
<p><strong>Positive vs. Negative Application Security</strong></p>
<p>The two approaches to security most often mentioned in the context of
application security—positive and negative are diametrically opposed in
all of their characteristic behaviors, but they are structured very
similarly. Both positive and negative security approaches operate
according to an established set of rules. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
and signatures are two implementation examples of positive and negative
security rules, respectively.</p>
<p>Positive security moves away from “blocked,” end of the spectrum,
following an “allow only what I know” methodology. Every rule added to a
positive security model increases what is classified as known behavior,
and thus allowed, and decreases what is blocked, or what is unknown.
Therefore, a positive security model with nothing defined should block
everything and relax (i.e., allow broader access) as the acceptable
content contexts are defined.</p>
<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, negative security moves towards
“blocked what I know is bad,” meaning it denies access based on what has
previously identified as content to be blocked, running opposite to the
known/allowed positive model. Every rule added to the negative security
policy increases the blocking behavior, thereby decreasing what is both
unknown and allowed as the policy is tightened. Therefore, a negative
security policy with nothing defined would grant access to everything,
and be tightened as exploits are discovered. Although negative security
does retain some aspect of known data, negative security knowledge comes
from a list of very specific repositories of matching patterns. As data
is passed through a negative security policy, it is evaluated against
individual known “bad” patterns. If a known pattern is matched, the data
is rejected; if the data flowing through the policy is unidentifiable,
it is allowed to pass. Negative security policies do not take into
account how the application works, they only notice what accesses the
application and if that access violates any negative security patterns.</p>
<p>Discussions on preferred security methods typically spawn very polarized
debates. Tried and true security engineers might ardently argue the
merits of the positive security model because it originates from the
most “secure” place—“Only allow what I know and expect.” Many business
pundits would argue that the negative model is the best as it starts in
the most “functional” place—</p>
<p>“Block what I know is bad and let everything unknown through.” Both
groups are correct and yet both opinions become irrelevant when
projected onto applied security, because both positive and negative
security is theoretical. Applied security falls somewhere in the middle
of the spectrum, providing a practical balance. At some point, as the
negative approach is tightened, it will take on characteristics of a
more positive model, inching towards a more complete security approach.</p>
<p>Likewise, as a positive security model is loosened to accommodate new
application behaviors, it will take on some aspects of a more negative
approach, such as implementing data pattern matching, to block the more
predictable attacks. As a positive policy continues to relax, it will
move closer towards complete functionality. The point at which these two
opposing concepts begin to overlap is where applied security starts to
take shape.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/1p30.png" src="../../_images/1p30.png" />
<p>This “meet in the middle” idea suggests that from an applied security
standpoint, both models are capable of achieving the same delicate
balance between “security” and “functionality.” The difference between
these models stems from where each begins and where they collide. This
can be as simple as the number of rules required to meet the end goal.</p>
<p>It is clear then that, from an operational efficiency standpoint, the
undiluted concepts of neither the positive nor the negative approach
intrinsically provides more efficiency than the other. In some cases,
the positive approach generates the least number of rules while in other
cases the negative approach generates the least. It would also appear
that it is the nature of the applied policy and/or the content itself,
which might determine the best approach. What then, are the qualities of
the policy or content which makes one approach more efficient over the
other?</p>
<p><strong>Factors of an Effective Applied Security Model</strong></p>
<p>Implementing successful application security architecture is not as easy
as deciding how much negative security and how much positive security to
mix together into a hypothetical applied security blender. By design,
application security devices have to have some level of application
knowledge, such as the type of content delivered by the application,
which is accessing any point within the application, and how to map
specific policy criteria to this information. Very specific application
awareness of this nature is essential in building an efficient applied
security policy.</p>
<p><strong>The Effect of Content Variability</strong></p>
<p>Within the scope of application security, Content Variability is a
measure of the content that needs to be secured and includes a number of
different component pieces: the number of objects, the number of types
of content, frequency of content change, and the nature of the content.
A site that only has five specific objects is much less variable than a
site with 500 specific objects. Within those objects, the cohesiveness
of the content type is also a factor; if all 500 objects share a common
format, they are less variable than a site with where all 500 objects
are unique. Obviously, a site that changes only once a year is much less
variable than one that changes daily. Finally, the nature of that
content—for example, whether it is dynamically generated or static is a
contributing factor. Essentially, variability is a measure of the site
complexity. The idea of Content Variability is a single measurable value
based on all of these factors. The variability of the content dictates
the amount of effort needed to achieve the prescribed applied security
from the chosen model.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/1p31.png" src="../../_images/1p31.png" />
<p>As depicted in the diagram, the higher the variability of the content,
the easier it is to define a policy using the negative security model.
As the complexity of the known content increases, it is easier to
describe what isn’t allowed rather than what is. Conversely, the
opposite effect is true of the positive model; the more variable the
site content, more effort is required to define those elements that are
allowed. For example, let us assume that we have 10 different types of
content within our site out of a possible 100 different types of content
known. Because the site exhibits little variability, or is more
cohesive, it is much easier to define the 10 allowable types of content
than to define the 90 types of restricted content; a positive model is
much more appropriate in this case.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the site is less cohesive, perhaps representing of
90 of the 100 different types, it now becomes more efficient to define
the 10 restricted content types than it is to define the 90 allowed
ones; thus a negative model is more efficient. Once again, both models
are equally successful at producing a desired level of security, but the
variability of the content determines which is more efficient in a given
scenario. And as we map the concept of content variability back to
applied security, it becomes obvious that we will take the necessary
aspects from the negative security model and couple those with what is
required from the positive model.</p>
<p>The most successful implementation will come from a joint applied
security policy, addressing both the security and the business needs at
same time.</p>
<p><strong>Rule Specificity</strong></p>
<p>As the content variability affects the ability to create and maintain a
security policy, the same is true of the specificity of rules used to
build that policy. Rule Specificity conveys the level of detail of the
protection mechanism implemented for any particular rule. For example, a
rule that blocks Unicode attacks may block them from any application on
one end of the spectrum all the way to only protecting Unicode directory
traversal attacks against IIS5 on the other end. Depending upon the
specificity of a rule, many things may be allowed with a single rule
(positive security) or disallowed with a single rule (negative
security). But as is the problem with theoretical security, Rule
Specificity itself is not an exact science.</p>
<p>A rule that is not specific enough may block too much, creating
unnecessary false positives (blocking access that shouldn’t be blocked);
a rule that is too specific may not block enough, creating false
negatives. Content variability also impacts the efficiency of a policy
by altering the level of specificity in the rules themselves. As the
variability of the content increases, the ability to specifically
stipulate what content is or isn’t allowed becomes more time consuming.
In an ideal world, every rule would be as specific as possible for the
particular application it was designed to protect, avoiding false
positives and false negatives. Similarly, the level of rule specificity
within an application security policy can vary greatly depending on the
content variability experienced by the application.</p>
<p><strong>Order of Precedence</strong></p>
<p>A third factor in implementing an efficient applied security policy is
the order of precedence: defining which parts of the security policy are
enacted before other parts of the policy. This concept is often seen in
programmatic search algorithms: “match first” or “match any.” Using a
combination of negative patterns and positive policy rules with varying
degrees of specificity is bound to create many conflicts. In order to
arbitrate these conflicts an order of precedence for all rules must be
defined and followed for the policy to remain coherent. This is a
critical decision point for application security, because the policy
must decide if it should implement a more funneled approach (parsing
through the policy to weed out what doesn’t match) or if it should look
for the most restrictive implementation first. Choosing the most
specific rule may solve this order of precedence, whether it is positive
or negative, and opening up access as data moves further through the
policy.</p>
<p>Alternately, the order may be based on implementing a given rule set,
for example, all traffic may be pattern matched first and if there are
any positive matches, the data is rejected, regardless of which specific
pattern was matched. No matter which method is chosen, if the policy is
implemented with an incorrect order of precedence, access to the
application could be blocked by a policy that tightens first. Likewise,
a policy that applies rules too loosely may allow unintended access to
the application.</p>
<p>And as precedence is factored into the applied security equation,
traffic volumes must also be taken into consideration. A two percent
false positive error rate may be an acceptable metric in an applied
security policy of an application that handles 100 connections/day, but
unacceptable for a 10 million connection/day application. Regardless of
the precedence methodology used it should be well defined and easy to
follow to make a policy easy to audit and manage.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion - Best Practices</strong></p>
<p>The problem with a purely positive policy is simply that it’s merely the
most appropriate model for about half of the situations in which it’s
deployed. The other half are unnecessarily weighed down by the fact that
a negative model would be much more efficient. That is why, as a matter
of best practice, every security solution should support a weighted
balance of both the positive and negative methodologies. In the
strictest sense of the term, negative security provides the best applied
security out of the box due to the effort applied by the security vendor
before the product is shipped. Focusing on known security
vulnerabilities, this will block the most attacks, despite content
variability. However, this does not provide security against unknown
attacks or allow specific functions to be allowed. For that, positive
security is required. To lessen the amount of effort needed for a given
application, positive security templates should be provided by the
application vendors themselves to complement the negative security.</p>
<p>If the goal of applied security is to reach a pre-defined posture in the
most efficient manner, then the choice of model is directly related to
the variability of the content itself. Somewhere between total security
and total functionality is where the desired applied security level
exists, and—theoretically—either security model is capable of achieving
this goal. But as stated above, theoretical security can only exist in a
vacuum. Applied security is a business choice and concept that moves
security into real-world implementations to attain the most efficient,
functional method. Neither positive nor negative security models alone
can deliver the most economical solution in every situation or
environment. Applied together, however—and merged with the business
needs and requirements—a holistic view of both approaches can help
delineate between theoretical security and applied security, enabling
businesses to realize the greatest ROI from any security policy
implementation.</p>

<p><strong>4.02 - Describe the purpose of signing</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Purpose of Signing</strong></p>
<p>A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the
authenticity of a digital message or document. A valid digital signature
gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a
known sender, that the sender cannot deny having sent the message
(authentication and non-repudiation), and that the message was not
altered in transit (integrity).</p>
<p>Digital signatures employ asymmetric cryptography. In many instances
they provide a layer of validation and security to messages sent through
a non-secure channel: Properly implemented, a digital signature gives
the receiver reason to believe the message was sent by the claimed
sender. Digital seals and signatures are equivalent to handwritten
signatures and stamped seals. Digital signatures are equivalent to
traditional handwritten signatures in many respects, but properly
implemented digital signatures are more difficult to forge than the
handwritten type. Digital signature schemes, in the sense used here, are
cryptographically based, and must be implemented properly to be
effective. Digital signatures can also provide non-repudiation, meaning
that the signer cannot successfully claim they did not sign a message,
while also claiming their private key remains secret; further, some
non-repudiation schemes offer a time stamp for the digital signature, so
that even if the private key is exposed, the signature is valid.
Digitally signed messages may be anything representable as a bitstring:
examples include electronic mail, contracts, or a message sent via some
other cryptographic protocol.</p>

<p><strong>4.02 - Describe the purpose of encryption</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html#purpose">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Topic</strong></p>
<p>In data and telecommunications, cryptography is necessary when
communicating over any untrusted medium, which includes just about any
network, particularly the Internet.</p>
<p>Within the context of any application-to-application communication,
there are some specific security requirements, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Authentication: The process of proving one’s identity. (The primary
forms of host-to-host authentication on the Internet today are
name-based or address-based, both of which are notoriously weak.)</li>
<li>Privacy/confidentiality: Ensuring that no one can read the message
except the intended receiver.</li>
<li>Integrity: Assuring the receiver that the received message has not
been altered in any way from the original.</li>
<li>Non-repudiation: A mechanism to prove that the sender really sent
this message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cryptography, then, not only protects data from theft or alteration, but
can also be used for user authentication. There are, in general, three
types of cryptographic schemes typically used to accomplish these goals:
secret key (or symmetric) cryptography, public-key (or asymmetric)
cryptography, and hash functions, each of which is described below. In
all cases, the initial unencrypted data is referred to as plaintext. It
is encrypted into ciphertext, which will in turn (usually) be decrypted
into usable plaintext.</p>

<p><strong>4.02 - Describe the purpose of certificates and the certificate
chains</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.entrust.com/chain-certificates/">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Certificates and Certificate Chains</strong></p>
<p>It all starts with something called a root certificate. The root
certificate is generated by a certification authority (CA) and is
embedded into software applications. You will find root certificates in
Microsoft Windows, Mozilla Firefox, Mac OS X, Adobe Reader, etc. The
purpose of the root certificate is to establish a digital chain of
trust. The root is the trust anchor.</p>
<p>The presumption is that the application developer has pre-screened the
CA, ensured it meets a minimum level of trust and has accepted the CA’s
root certificate for use. Many application developers, including Adobe,
Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft, Opera and Oracle, have root certificate
programs. Others rely on the roots provided by the underlying operating
system or developer toolkit.</p>
<p>One of the main functions of the root is to issue chain certificates to
issuing CAs who are the first link in the chain of trust. Your Web
browser will inherently trust all certificates that have been signed by
any root that has been embedded in the browser itself or in an operating
system on which it relies.</p>
<p>Why do you need an issuing CA? The purpose of the issuing CA is to
isolate certificate policy from the root. Issuing CAs can be used to
issue many different certificate types: SSL, EV SSL, Code Signing,
Secure Email, Adobe CDS, etc. These certificate types are subjected to
different requirements and risks, and as such have different certificate
policies. The certificates may have different assurance levels such as
high, medium and low. Issuing CAs may also be controlled by an
organization other than that which controls the root.</p>
<p>The last link of trust is that between the end entity certificate and
the issuing CA. In the case of an SSL certificate, the end entity
certificate represents the linkage between a website owner and the
website domain name. The SSL certificate is installed on the Web server
along with the chain certificate. When a user browses to the website
protected by the SSL certificate, the browser initiates the verification
of the certificate and follows the chain of trust back to the embedded
root.</p>
<p>In some cases, the CA may have chosen to issue end entity certificates
directly from the root CA. This is an outdated practice; issuing
directly from the root increases risk and limits how certificate policy
can be managed and enforced.</p>

<p><strong>4.02 - Distinguish between private/public keys</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tldp.org/REF/INTRO/SecuringData-INTRO/encryption.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Private Key Encryption</strong></p>
<p>Private key encryption is the standard form. Both parties share an
encryption key, and the encryption key is also the one used to decrypt
the message. The difficulty is sharing the key before you start
encrypting the message - how do you safely transmit it?</p>
<p>Many private key encryption methods use public key encryption to
transmit the private key for each data transfer session.</p>
<p>If Bob and Alice want to use private key encryption to share a secret
message, they would each use a copy of the same key. Bob writes his
message to Alice and uses their shared private key to encrypt the
message. The message is then sent to Alice. Alice uses her copy of the
private key to decrypt the message. Private key encryption is like
making copies of a key. Anyone with a copy can open the lock. In the
case of Bob and Alice, their keys would be guarded closely because they
can both encrypt and decrypt messages.</p>
<p><strong>Public Key Encryption</strong></p>
<p>Public key encryption uses two keys - one to encrypt, and one to
decrypt. The sender asks the receiver for the encryption key, encrypts
the message, and sends the encrypted message to the receiver. Only the
receiver can then decrypt the message - even the sender cannot read the
encrypted message.</p>
<p>When Bob wants to share a secret with Alice using public key encryption,
he first asks Alice for her public key. Next, Bob uses Alice’s public
key to encrypt the message. In public key encryption, only Alice’s
private key can unlock the message encrypted with her public key. Bob
sends his message to Alice. Alice uses her private key to decrypt Bob’s
message.</p>
<p>The thing that makes public key encryption work is that Alice very
closely guards her private key and freely distributes her public key.
She knows that it will unlock any message encrypted with her public key.</p>

<p><strong>4.02 - Compare and contrast symmetric/asymmetric encryption</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.f5.com">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Symmetric Encryption</strong></p>
<p>This system uses only private keys, which can be anything from a
numerical symbol to a string of random letters. These private keys are
used to encode a message, so that only the sender and the recipient of
the message who know what the secret key is can “unlock” it and decrypt
it. The system works pretty much like two best friends using a decoder
ring to send secret messages to each other. The symmetric system’s only
downside is the potentially unsafe private key transmission via the
Internet, where other people can “crack” it and decode the message.</p>
<p><strong>Asymmetric Encryption</strong></p>
<p>As a solution for the not completely safe Symmetric Encryption, there is
the Asymmetric Encryption system that uses a pair of keys for added
security: a private and a public key. The private key is for yourself
and the public key is published online for others to see.</p>
<p>The public key is used to access the encryption code that corresponds to
your private key. So, if you were sending an encrypted message to Susan,
which you do not want others to see, you would use her public key to
encrypt it. She will be able to decrypt it with her own corresponding
private key. Likewise, if she sends a message to you, she uses your
public key to encrypt the message and you would use your private key to
decrypt it.</p>

<p><strong>4.03 - Explain the purpose of authentication</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.authenticationworld.com">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>What Is Authentication?</strong></p>
<p>Authentication is the process of determining if a user or identity is
who they claim to be. Authentication is accomplished using something the
user knows (e.g. password), something the user has (e.g. security token)
or something of the user (e.g. biometric).</p>
<p>The authentication process is based on a measure of risk. High risk
systems, applications and information require different forms of
authentication that more accurately confirm the user’s digital identity
as being who they claim to be than would a low risk application, where
the confirmation of the digital identity is not as important from a risk
perspective. This is commonly referred to as “stronger authentication”.</p>
<p>Authentication processes are dependent upon identity verification and
registration processes. For example, when Jane Doe is hired at an
enterprise, she provides the enterprise with information and tokens of
who she is (e.g. name, address, driver’s license, birth certificate, a
SSN number, a passport, etc.). The enterprise may choose to immediately
accept this information or, it may instead chose to run background
checks on Jane to see if she is who she claims to be and determine if
she has any criminal record. When the checks come back favorably, the
enterprise will accept her identity and enter her into their systems.
The identity registration process will usually involve issuing Jane with
enterprise authentication mechanisms such as id and password, security
token, digital certificate and/or registering some of her biometrics.</p>
<p>The authentication process is totally dependents on the identity
validation and registration process used for Jane. If Jane presents
false tokens, which are accepted by the enterprise, then the person
acting as Jane will be positively authenticated every time, even though
she is not the real Jane Doe. Authentication security therefore is only
as good as the weakest link in the chain.</p>

<p><strong>4.03 - Explain the advantages of single sign on</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.authenticationworld.com">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Password Authentication</strong></p>
<p>Password authentication is the most common method of authentication. It
is also the least secure. Password authentication requires the identity
to input a user id and a password in order to login. Password length,
type of characters used and password duration are password management is
now critical concern in enterprises. The ability to easily crack
passwords has resulted in high levels of identity theft. As a result,
the high risk of passwords means most enterprises now deploy a layered
security strategy. A user enters in their id and password for initial
login to gain access to only low risk information and applications with
other forms of authentication required for higher risk information and
applications.</p>
<p><strong>Single Sign On Authentication</strong></p>
<p>Single Sign On (SSO), Reduced Sign On (RSO), or Enterprise Single Sign
On (ESSO) is the ability to reduce the number of id’s and passwords a
user has to remember. In most enterprises, a strong business case can be
made to implement single sign on by reducing the number of password
related help desk calls. SSO is also the architecture to require
stronger forms of authentication for higher risk information and
applications. Thus a user may login using their id and password to gain
general low risk access to an enterprise. The SSO software enables them
to not have to use multiple IDs and passwords. However, when the user
tries to access more sensitive information and applications, the single
sign on software will require the identity to input stronger
authentication such as a security token, a digital certificate and/or a
biometric.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/multifactor-authentication-MFA">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Multi-factor Authentication</strong></p>
<p>Multifactor authentication (MFA) is a security system in which more than
one form of authentication is implemented to verify the legitimacy of a
transaction. The goal of MFA is to create a layered defense and make it
more difficult for an unauthorized person to access a computer system or
network.</p>
<p>Multifactor authentication is achieved by combining two or three
independent credentials: what the user knows (knowledge-based
authentication), what the user has (security token or smart card) and
what the user is (biometric verification). Single-factor authentication
(SFA), in contrast, only requires knowledge the user possesses. Although
password-based authentication is well suited for website or application
access, it is not secure enough for online financial transactions.</p>

<p><strong>4.03 - Describe the role authentication plays in AAA</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/authentication-authorization-and-accounting">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)</strong></p>
<p>Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a term for a
framework for intelligently controlling access to computer resources,
enforcing policies, auditing usage, and providing the information
necessary to bill for services. These combined processes are considered
important for effective network management and security.</p>
<p>As the first process, authentication provides a way of identifying a
user, typically by having the user enter a valid user name and valid
password before access is granted. The process of authentication is
based on each user having a unique set of criteria for gaining access.
The AAA server compares a user’s authentication credentials with other
user credentials stored in a database. If the credentials match, the
user is granted access to the network. If the credentials are at
variance, authentication fails and network access is denied.</p>
<p>Following authentication, a user must gain authorization for doing
certain tasks. After logging into a system, for instance, the user may
try to issue commands. The authorization process determines whether the
user has the authority to issue such commands. Simply put, authorization
is the process of enforcing policies: determining what types or
qualities of activities, resources, or services a user is permitted.
Usually, authorization occurs within the context of authentication. Once
you have authenticated a user, they may be authorized for different
types of access or activity.</p>
<p>The final plank in the AAA framework is accounting, which measures the
resources a user consumes during access. This can include the amount of
system time or the amount of data a user has sent and/or received during
a session. Accounting is carried out by logging of session statistics
and usage information and is used for authorization control, billing,
trend analysis, resource utilization, and capacity planning activities.</p>
<p>Authentication, authorization, and accounting services are often
provided by a dedicated AAA server, or a program that performs these
functions. A current standard by which network access servers interface
with the AAA server is the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service
(RADIUS).</p>

<p><strong>4.03 - SAML Authentication Not on Blueprint</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.skydesk.jp/en/help/portal/saml/SAML-Authentication.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>SAML Authentication - What is SAML?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAML - Security Assertion Markup Language</strong></p>
<p>SAML, developed by the Security Services Technical Committee of
“Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards”
(OASIS), is an XML-based framework for exchanging user authentication,
entitlement, and attribute information. SAML is a derivative of XML. The
purpose of SAML is to enable Single Sign-On for web applications across
various domains.</p>
<p><strong>Why SAML?</strong></p>
<p>There are four ‘drivers’ behind the creation of the SAML standard:</p>
<p>Limitations of Browser cookies: Most existing Single-Sign On products
use browser cookies to maintain state so that re-authentication is not
required. Browser cookies are not transferred between DNS domains. So,
if you obtain a cookie from www.abc.com, then that cookie will not be
sent in any HTTP messages to www.xyz.com. This could even apply within
an organization that has separate DNS domains. Therefore, to solve the
Cross-Domain SSO (CDSSO) problem requires the application of different
technology. All SSO products solve the CDSSO problem by different
techniques.</p>
<p>SSO Interoperability: How products implement SSO and CDSSO are
completely proprietary. If you have an organization and you want to
perform SSO across different DNS domains within the same organization or
you want to perform CDSSO to trading partners, then you will have to use
the same SSO product in all the domains.</p>
<p>Web Services: Security within Web Services is still being defined. Most
of the focus has been on how to provide confidentiality and
authentication/integrity services on an end-to-end basis. The SAML
standard provides the means by which authentication and authorization
assertions can exchanged between communicating parties.</p>
<p>Federation: The need to simplify identity management across
organizational boundaries, allowing users to consolidate many local
identities into a single (or at least a reduced set).</p>

<p><strong>4.04 - Explain the purpose, advantages, and challenges associated with IPsec</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>IPsec - IP Security</strong></p>
<p>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a protocol suite for securing
Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting
each IP packet of a communication session. IPsec includes protocols for
establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of
the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the
session. IPsec can be used in protecting data flows between a pair of
hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways
(network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host
(network-to-host).</p>
<p>Internet Protocol security (IPsec) uses cryptographic security services
to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec
supports network-level peer authentication, data origin authentication,
data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay
protection.</p>
<p>IPsec is an end-to-end security scheme operating in the Internet Layer
of the Internet Protocol Suite, while some other Internet security
systems in widespread use, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
Secure Shell (SSH), operate in the upper layers at Application layer.
Hence, only IPsec protects any application traffic over an IP network.
IPsec can automatically secure applications at the IP layer.point
environments.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.sonicwall.com/downloads/WP_SSLVPN_vs_IPSec_102907.pdf">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Why should you use IPsec?</strong></p>
<p>IPSec VPNs are best suited for point-to-point access. Open tunneling
protects data between two private networks or between IT-managed
machines and a private network. IPSec is a perfectly viable solution
when a permanent connection is required between two specific locations,
for example between a branch or remote office and a corporate
headquarters. It can also be used successfully to provide access to a
small finite number of remote workers using tightly controlled
corporate-issued laptops.</p>
<p>Many existing IPSec implementations can continue to work well for these
use cases for which they were originally deployed. IT might consider
keeping IPSec in these limited areas and extend remote access to other
areas, such as trusted partners or extranet users, via a parallel SSL
VPN solution. While a parallel VPN implementation is a viable choice for
some enterprises, transitioning all access use cases through a single
SSL VPN gateway might ultimately cost less and be easier to manage.</p>
<p>While many organizations still implement IPSec solutions today, however,
for secure remote access the momentum has clearly shifted to SSL VPNs.
Some organizations replace older versions of IPSec with newer versions
that better streamline the provisioning of agents, or provide elements
of end point control.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these augmented IPSec VPNs still may not be as flexible or
robust as SSL VPN solutions.</p>
<p>With increased access from unmanaged end point devices, end point
control becomes a key risk factor. For managed devices, some IPSec
solution providers suggest keeping IPSec and adding a network access
control (NAC) solution. However, this greatly adds to the costs and
complexity of administering and maintaining a separate appliance to
achieve end point control, and still does not provide granular access
controls down to the application layer, essentially allowing the remote
device to be a node on the network.</p>
<p><strong>Replacing IPsec</strong></p>
<p>The ascendancy of IPSec technology as an innovative remote access
solution peaked nearly a decade ago. IPSec VPNs are no longer an
effective remote access solution when comparing costs of IT overhead and
the desire for granular access controls for highly portal devices with
the current demands of an increasingly mobile workforce. With early
IPSec implementations, the considerable overhead involved in
provisioning, maintaining and supporting dedicated IPSec clients was
tolerated because IPSec access tended to be restricted only to
relatively few managed-device use cases. In recent years, however, since
broadband has become widespread and laptops have become cheaper, there
has been greater incentive for IT to deploy more laptops and other
mobile devices to more users across the enterprise, increasing the
overhead needed to support distributed-client IPSec VPNs. While these
devices are more likely to be transported beyond the physical office to
be used at home or other remote sites, IPSec still views them as nodes
on the network, regardless of location.</p>
<p>Workers are also now accessing corporate resources from more end point
devices that are not directly managed by IT, such as home computers,
WiFi-enabled laptops, PDAs, smartphones and public kiosks.</p>
<p>While most workers today are not full-time teleworkers, many commonly
perform teleworking functions, such as sending and receiving e-mail and
attachments from home before or after work hours, on weekends, while on
the road or while on vacation. In addition, business partners need
limited access to specific network resources, which introduces
additional remote access challenges to the IT department in today’s
world of outsourced supply chains. By providing employees and business
partners with wider access to business tools and information, the
proliferation of unmanaged end point devices has directly resulted in
increased productivity. But it has also greatly increased the complexity
for IT in controlling remote access, thereby minimizing the viability of
distributed-client IPSec VPNs as an efficient remote access solution.</p>
<p><em>But still IPsec tunnels are still commonly used in site-to-site communications.</em></p>

than IPSec, working at the application layer rather than at the network
layer. By operating at the application layer, SSL can provide the highly
granular policy and access control required for secure remote access.
Because SSL is included in all modern browsers, SSL VPNs can empower
today’s mobile workforce with clientless remote access—while saving IT
departments the headache of installing and managing the complexity of
IPSec clients. By extending the workplace to home PCs, kiosks,</p>
<p>SSL VPN solutions increase workforce productivity, for users with PDAs,
and other unmanaged devices, resulting in a greater return on
investment. And by eliminating the need to deploy and support “fat”
clients, SSL VPN reduces IT overhead, resulting in a lower total cost of
ownership.</p>
<p>An SSL VPN uses SSL to provide end users with authorized and secure
access for Web, client/server and file share resources. SSL VPNs deliver
user-level authentication, ensuring that only authorized users have
access to the specific resources allowed by the company’s security
policy. SSL VPNs start with providing access via a Web browser, removing
the need for IT to provision clients to the end point device. For
advanced access, agents may be required but SSL VPNs allow IT to have
agents provisioned and activated within the context of the Web browser
where Active X or Java based “thin” clients are transparently pushed
through the browser, Alternatively, most SSL VPNs allow IT to
pre-provision the agents directly to a user’s device, allowing the user
to directly access the SSL VPN without having to open a Web browser.</p>
<p>Potential Benefits of Transitioning to an SSL VPN:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Increased productivity: SSL VPNs work in more places, including home
PCs, kiosks, PDAs and unmanaged devices over wired and wireless
networks.</li>
<li>Lower costs: SSL VPNs are clientless or use lightweight Web-delivered
clients rather than “fat” IPSec clients, reducing management and
support calls.</li>
<li>Broadened security: SSL VPNs provide granular access and end point
control to managed and non-managed devices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why you should transition to SSL VPN</strong></p>
<p>Today’s modern mobile workforce demands more secure access to more
resources from more remote devices and platforms than ever before.
Corporate boundaries are blurring, with partners, vendors and
consultants playing as vital a role in daily operations as employees do.
These changes suggest the need for an inverted model for the corporate
network, evolving from the traditional enclosed-perimeter model to a
distributed global network that connects employees, partners and
customers over multiple Internet, intranet and VoIP channels. IT
managers must now assume that any user and device is a potential risk
point, whether the user is accessing remotely or plugged directly into
the LAN. Disaster recovery and business continuity initiatives pose
additional incentive to provide remote access from any end point
location. Policy based granular access control becomes imperative.</p>
<p>Securing inverted networks with granular access control is an ideal use
case for SSL VPN technology. SSL based access control appliances are the
key to achieving application access control. SSL VPN solutions can
detect what is running on the end point device, protect applications
with granular access control based on user identity and device integrity
and connect users securely and easily to applications on any device.</p>
<p>Because SSL is part of any Web browser, SSL VPN solutions provide
clientless and Web-delivered thin client access that significantly
increases the number of points from which employees, partners and
customers can access network data. SSL VPN solutions greatly simplify
the connection process for mobile 7 users, seamlessly traversing NAT,
firewalls and proxy servers. SSL VPN solutions reduce IT support costs,
lowering total cost of ownership. SSL VPN clientless access minimizes
the IT overhead involved in provisioning, configuring and maintaining an
enterprise remote access solution. Alternatively, certain SSL</p>
<p>VPN tunnel solutions provide a complete “in-office” experience by
deploying an auto-updating, Web delivered thin client, eliminating the
need for direct IT intervention. SSL VPN solutions also streamline
administration costs by controlling all access to enterprise resources
via a single, centralized gateway.</p>
<p>SSL VPN solutions also provide greater security compared to IPSec. Since
SSL is an application layer protocol, an SSL VPN is inherently better
suited for securing application-based remote access. SSL VPN solutions
provide secure, granular access controls, ensuring that users gain
access only to the designated resources or applications specific to
their needs and according to security policy.</p>
<p>With SSL VPN solutions, end-user access to any given resource is
restricted unless authorized. As a result, SSL VPN technology provides
the granular access control that requires all users, regardless of
location, to be granted explicit permission to access specific network
resources. With SSL VPN technology, access control to applications and
networks can be as general or specific as required to meet regulatory
compliance and corporate security mandates.</p>

<p><strong>4.04 - Given a list of environments/situations, determine which is
appropriate for an IPsec solution and which is appropriate for an SSL
VPN solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>SSL VPN vs IPSec</strong></p>
<p>When presented with scenario-based questions on which solution is more
appropriate IPSec or SSL VPN. Just remember that SSL VPN is the best
solution for remote users to access business resources remotely and
IPSec is the best solution for tunneling traffic between two business
locations.</p>
