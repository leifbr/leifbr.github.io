<p><strong>The OSI Model</strong></p>
<p>The term OSI Model is short for Open System Interconnection Basic
Reference Model. The OSI Model consists of seven different layers. Each
layer of the model is designed so that it can perform a specific task,
and facilitates communications between the layer above it and the layer
below it. You can see what the OSI Model looks like in the figure below.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/1p1.png" src="../../_images/1p1.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>The Application Layer</strong></p>
<p>The top layer of the OSI model is the Application layer. The first thing
that you need to understand about the application layer is that it does
not refer to the actual applications that users run. Instead, it
provides the framework that the actual applications run on top of.</p>
<p>To understand what the application layer does, suppose that a user
wanted to use Internet Explorer to open an FTP session and transfer a
file. In this particular case, the application layer would define the
file transfer protocol. This protocol is not directly accessible to the
end user. The end user must still use an application that is designed to
interact with the file transfer protocol. In this case, Internet
Explorer would be that application.</p>
<p><strong>The Presentation Layer</strong></p>
<p>The presentation layer does some rather complex things, but everything
that the presentation layer does can be summed up in one sentence. The
presentation layer takes the data that is provided by the application
layer, and converts it into a standard format that the other layers can
understand. Likewise, this layer converts the inbound data that is
received from the session layer into something that the application
layer can understand. The reason why this layer is necessary is because
applications handle data differently from one another. In order for
network communications to function properly, the data needs to be
structured in a standard way.</p>
<p><strong>The Session Layer</strong></p>
<p>Once the data has been put into the correct format, the sending host
must establish a session with the receiving host. This is where the
session layer comes into play. It is responsible for establishing,
maintaining, and eventually terminating the session with the remote
host.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the session layer is that it is more closely
related to the application layer than it is to the physical layer. It is
easy to think of connecting a network session as being a hardware
function, but sessions are established between applications. If a user
is running multiple applications, several of those applications may have
established sessions with remote resources at any time.</p>
<p><strong>The Transport Layer</strong></p>
<p>The Transport layer is responsible for maintaining flow control. An
operating system allows users to run multiple applications
simultaneously and it is therefore possible that multiple applications
may need to communicate over the network simultaneously. The Transport
Layer takes the data from each application, and integrates it all into a
single stream. This layer is also responsible for providing error
checking and performing data recovery when necessary. In essence, the
Transport Layer is responsible for ensuring that all of the data makes
it from the sending host to the receiving host.</p>
<p><strong>The Network Layer</strong></p>
<p>The Network Layer is responsible for determining how the data will reach
the recipient. This layer handles things like addressing, routing, and
logical protocols. Since this series is geared toward beginners, I do
not want to get too technical, but I will tell you that the Network
Layer creates logical paths, known as virtual circuits, between the
source and destination hosts. This circuit provides the individual
packets with a way to reach their destination. The Network Layer is also
responsible for its own error handling, and for packet sequencing and
congestion control.</p>
<p>Packet sequencing is necessary because each protocol limits the maximum
size of a packet. The amount of data that must be transmitted often
exceeds the maximum packet size. Therefore, the data is fragmented into
multiple packets. When this happens, the Network Layer assigns each
packet a sequence number. When the data is received by the remote host,
that deviceâs Network layer examines the sequence numbers of the inbound
packets, and uses the sequence number to reassemble the data and to
figure out if any packets are missing. If you are having trouble
understanding this concept, then imagine that you need to mail a large
document to a friend, but do not have a big enough envelope. You could
put a few pages into several small envelopes, and then label the
envelopes so that your friend knows what order the pages go in. This is
exactly the same thing that the Network Layer does.</p>
<p><strong>The Data Link Layer</strong></p>
<p>The data link layer can be sub divided into two other layers; the Media
Access Control (MAC) layer, and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer.
The MAC layer basically establishes the computerâs identity on the
network, via its MAC address. A MAC address is the address that is
assigned to a network adapter at the hardware level. This is the address
that is ultimately used when sending and receiving packets. The LLC
layer controls frame synchronization and provides a degree of error
checking.</p>
<p><strong>The Physical Layer</strong></p>
<p>The physical layer of the OSI model refers to the actual hardware
specifications. The Physical Layer defines characteristics such as
timing and voltage. The physical layer defines the hardware
specifications used by network adapters and by the network cables
(assuming that the connection is not wireless). To put it simply, the
physical layer defines what it means to transmit and to receive data.</p>

<p><strong>1.01 - Differentiate between the OSI layers</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/docs/DOC-15624">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>OSI Layers</strong></p>
<p>Application (Layer 7)</p>
<p>This layer supports application and end-user processes. Communication
partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user
authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data
syntax are identified. Everything at this layer is application-specific.
This layer provides application services for file transfers, e-mail, and
other network software services.</p>
<p>Presentation (Layer 6)</p>
<p>This layer provides independence from differences in data representation
(e.g., encryption) by translating from application to network format,
and vice versa. This layer formats and encrypts data to be sent across a
network, providing freedom from compatibility problems. It is sometimes
called the syntax layer.</p>
<p>Transport (Layer 4)</p>
<p>This layer provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or
hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow
control. It ensures complete data transfer.</p>
<p>Network (Layer 3)</p>
<p>This layer provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical
paths, known as virtual circuits, for transmitting data from node to
node. Routing and forwarding are functions of this layer, as well as
addressing, internetworking, error handling, congestion control and
packet sequencing.</p>
<p>Data Link (Layer 2)</p>
<p>This layer provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical
paths, known as virtual circuits, for transmitting data from node to
node. Routing and forwarding are functions of this layer, as well as
addressing, internetworking, error handling, congestion control and
packet sequencing.</p>

<p><strong>1.02 - Explain the purpose of a switchâs forwarding database</strong></p>
<p><strong>Forwarding Database</strong></p>
<p>A forwarding database is a table used by a Layer 2 device
(switch/bridge) to store the learned MAC addresses of nodes on the
attached local broadcast domain/domains (VLANS) and the port (interface)
that MAC address was learned on. The MAC addresses are learned
transparently as the switch forwards traffic.</p>
<p>How it works</p>
<p>When an Ethernet frame arrives at a Layer 2 device, the Layer 2 device
will inspect the source MAC address of the frame and associate it to the
port that the frame arrived on in the forwarding database. This simply
creates a table that can be cross-referenced for device locations. When
the table is populated it allows the Layer 2 device to look at the
destination MAC address of the arriving Ethernet frame and find the
destination port for that MAC address, to know where to send that
specific Ethernet frame. If the FDB table doesnât have any information
on that specific MAC address it will flood the Ethernet frame out to all
ports in the broadcast domain (VLAN).</p>

<p><strong>1.02 - Explain the purpose and functionality of ARP</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://linux-ip.net/html/ether-arp.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>ARP</strong></p>
<p>ARP defines the exchanges between network interfaces connected to an
Ethernet media segment in order to map an IP address to a link layer
address on demand. Link layer addresses are hardware addresses (although
they are not immutable) on Ethernet cards and IP addresses are logical
addresses assigned to machines attached to the Ethernet. Link layer
addresses may be known by many different names: Ethernet addresses,
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, and even hardware addresses.</p>
<p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) exists solely to glue together the IP
and Ethernet networking layers. Since networking hardware such as
switches, hubs, and bridges operate on Ethernet frames, they are unaware
of the higher layer data carried by these frames. Similarly, IP layer
devices, operating on IP packets need to be able to transmit their IP
data on Ethernets. ARP defines the conversation by which IP capable
hosts can exchange mappings of their Ethernet and IP addressing.</p>
<p>ARP is used to locate the Ethernet address associated with a desired IP
address. When a machine has a packet bound for another IP on a locally
connected Ethernet network, it will send a broadcast Ethernet frame
containing an ARP request onto the Ethernet. All machines with the same
Ethernet broadcast address will receive this packet. If a machine
receives the ARP request and it hosts the IP requested, it will respond
with the link layer address on which it will receive packets for that IP
address.</p>
<p>Once the requestor receives the response packet, it associates the MAC
address and the IP address. This information is stored in the ARP cache.</p>

<p><strong>1.02 - Explain the purpose and functionality of MAC addresses</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tech-faq.com/ethernet-at-the-data-link-layer.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>MAC Addresses</strong></p>
<p>Every network device has a unique physical identity that is assigned by
the manufacturing vendor is called MAC address or Ethernet address. The
MAC address is also known as the hardware address while the IP address
is the logical address of the device. The MAC address is defined in the
Hexadecimal format generally. It consists of 6-byte (48 bits) where the
first three bytes are used as the identity of the vendor and the last
three bytes are used as the node identity. The MAC address works on the
MAC sub-layer of the data link layer of the OSI model.</p>
<p>Switches give network managers the ability to increase bandwidth without
adding unnecessary complexity to the network. Layer 2 data frames
consist of both infrastructure content, such as end user content and MAC
Media Access Control address also known as Ethernet address. At Data
Link layer, no modification is required to the MAC address of the data
frame when going between like physical layer interfaces, such as from
Ethernet to Fast Ethernet. However, changes to Media Access Control
(MAC) address of the data frames might occur when bridging between
unlike media types such as FDDI and Ethernet or Token Ring and Ethernet.</p>
<p>Switches learn the MAC address and build a table on the base of MAC
addressing of the LAN segment called MAC Address Table. The Address
Resolution Protocol (ARP) is the protocol that resolves the IP addresses
into MAC addresses. RARP, the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol is a
reverse of ARP and resolves MAC addresses into IP addresses.</p>
<p>The MAC layer of the Gigabit Ethernet is similar to those of standard
Ethernet and Fast Ethernet. Media Access Layer of Gigabit Ethernet
should maintain full duplex and half duplex broadcasting. The
characteristics of Ethernet, such as collision detection, maximum
network diameter, repeater rules, MAC addressing and so forth, will be
the same of the Gigabit Ethernet. Support for half duplex Ethernet adds
frame bursting and carrier extension, two functions not found in
Ethernet and Fast Ethernet.</p>

<p><strong>1.02 - Explain the purpose and functionality of a broadcast domain</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tech-faq.com/broadcast-domain.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Domain</strong></p>
<p>A broadcast domain is a logical part of a network (a network segment) in
which any network equipment can transmit data directly to other
equipment or device without going through a routing device (assuming the
devices share the same subnet and use the same gateway; also, they must
be in the same VLAN).</p>
<p>A more specific broadcast domain definition is the area of the computer
network that consists of every single computer or network-attached
device that can be reached directly by sending a simple frame to the
data link layerâs broadcast address.</p>
<p><strong>Details on Broadcast Domains</strong></p>
<p>While any layer 2 device is able to divide the collision domains,
broadcast domains are only divided by layer 3 network devices such as
routers or layer 3 switches. Frames are normally addressed to a specific
destination device on the network. While all devices detect the frame
transmission on the network, only the device to which the frame is
addressed actually receives it. A special broadcast address consisting
of all is used to send frames to all devices on the network. The VLAN
(Virtual Local Area Network) technology can also create a so-called
âvirtualâ broadcast domain. A network built with switching devices can
see each network device as an independent system. These groups of
independent systems can be joined into one broadcast domain, even if the
computers are not physically connected to each other. This is very
useful when administrating large networks where there is the need for
better network management and control.</p>

<p><strong>How to Restrict the Broadcast Domain</strong></p>
<p>Since a broadcast domain is the area where broadcasts can be received,
routers restrict broadcasts. If a router receives a broadcast signal, it
simply drops it. In other words, the edge or border router connected to
the Internet will not up-broadcast or will not relay that broadcast
message. This is problematic and not foolproof either. Suppose two
networks exist that are connected to each other through a router and the
first network has a running DHCP server that offers IP addresses to
networked systems. On the other side, there is no valid DHCP server
running on the second network. Offering IP addresses from the first
networkâs DHCP server to the second networkâs systems can be a difficult
task to accomplish since DHCP is a broadcast and the router that joins
the networks drops the broadcast traffic. This leaves any DHCP request
in the second network unanswered. Many router manufacturers provide
capabilities for DHCP forwarding to solve this problem. This can be
bypassed by connecting the two networks with a well-configured,
Linux-based, purpose oriented software router. That will handle the job
properly and prevent further issues.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)</strong></p>
<p>In technical terms, a VLAN is a virtual broadcast domain created inside
a switch. Normally, a Layer2 device acts as a single LAN with all ports
active in the LAN. In a manageable switch, the switch has the ability to
be configured to group any amount of its physical ports into logical
VLANs where each is an individual broadcast domain.</p>
<p>Because switches can talk to each other when linked together, if the
same VLAN number exists in both switches devices in each switch in the
same VLAN can talk to each other as if it were all one switch.
Broadcasts between these devices will not be seen on any other port in
any other VLAN, other than the one in which they are configured. Just
like with physical LANs, without a router they would not be able to
communicate with any devices in a different VLAN.</p>
<p><strong>Are VLANs required?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to point out that you donât have to configure a VLAN
until your network gets so large and has so much traffic that you need
one. Many times, people are simply using VLANâs because the network they
are working on was already using them.</p>
<p>Another important fact is that, on a Cisco switch, VLANâs are enabled by
default and ALL devices are already in a VLAN. The VLAN that all devices
are already in is VLAN 1. So, by default, you can just use all the ports
on a switch and all devices will be able to talk to one another.</p>
<p><strong>When do I need a VLAN?</strong></p>
<p>You need to consider using VLANâs in any of the following situations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You have more than 200 devices on your LAN</li>
<li>You have a lot of broadcast traffic on your LAN</li>
<li>Groups of users need more security or are being slowed down by too
many broadcasts?</li>
<li>Groups of users need to be on the same broadcast domain because they
are running the same applications. An example would be a company that
has VoIP phones. The users using the phone could be on a different
VLAN, not with the regular users.</li>
<li>Or, just to make a single switch into multiple virtual switches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why not just subnet my network?</strong></p>
<p>A common question is why not just subnet the network instead of using
VLANâs? Each VLAN should be in its own subnet. The benefit that a VLAN
provides over a subnetted network is that devices in different physical
locations, not going back to the same router, can be on the same
network. The limitation of subnetting a network with a router is that
all devices on that subnet must be connected to the same switch and that
switch must be connected to a port on the router. With a VLAN, one
device can be connected to one switch, another device can be connected
to another switch, and those devices can still be on the same VLAN
(broadcast domain).</p>
<p><strong>How can devices on different VLANâs communicate?</strong></p>
<p>Devices on different VLANâs can communicate with a router or a Layer 3
switch. As each VLAN is its own subnet, a router or Layer 3 switch must
be used to route between the subnets.</p>
<p><strong>What is a trunk port?</strong></p>
<p>When there is a link between two switches or a router and a switch that
carries the traffic of more than one VLAN, that port is a trunk port. A
trunk port must run a special trunking protocol. The protocol used would
be Ciscoâs proprietary Inter- switch link (ISL) or the IEEE standard
802.1q, which is the protocol F5 devices support.</p>
<p><strong>What do VLANâs offer?</strong></p>
<p>VLANâs offer higher performance for medium and large LANâs because they
limit broadcasts. As the amount of traffic and the number of devices
grow, so does the number of broadcast packets. By using VLANâs you are
containing broadcasts. VLANâs also provide security because you are
essentially putting one group of devices, in one VLAN, on their own
network.</p>

<p><strong>1.02 - Explain the purpose and functionality of link aggregation</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos_management_guide_10_1/tmos_trunks.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Introducing trunks</strong></p>
<p>A trunk is a logical grouping of interfaces on the BIG-IP system. When
you create a trunk, this logical group of interfaces functions as a
single interface. The BIG-IP system uses a trunk to distribute traffic
across multiple links, in a process known as <strong>link aggregation</strong>.
With link aggregation, a trunk increases the bandwidth of a link by
adding the bandwidth of multiple links together. For example, four fast
Ethernet (100 Mbps) links, if aggregated, create a single 400 Mbps link.</p>
<p>With one trunk, you can aggregate a maximum of eight links. For optimal
performance, you should aggregate links in powers of two. Thus, you
ideally aggregate two, four, or eight links.</p>
<p>The purpose of a trunk is two-fold: To increase bandwidth without
upgrading hardware, and to provide link failover if a member link
becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>You can use trunks to transmit traffic from a BIG-IP system to another
vendor switch. Two systems that use trunks to exchange frames are known
as peer systems.</p>
<p>How do trunks work?</p>
<p>In a typical configuration where trunks are configured, the member links
of the trunk are connected through Ethernet cables to corresponding
links on a peer system. Figure 9.1 shows an example of a typical trunk
configuration with two peers and three member links on each peer.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/1p5.png" src="../../_images/1p5.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>A primary goal of the trunks feature is to ensure that frames exchanged
between peer systems are never sent out of order or duplicated on the
receiving end. The BIG-IP system is able to maintain frame order by
using the source and destination addresses in each frame to calculate a
hash value, and then transmitting all frames with that hash value on the
same member link.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system automatically assigns a unique MAC address to a trunk.
However, by default, the MAC address that the system uses as the source
and destination address for frames that the system transmits and
receives (respectively), is the MAC address of the lowest-numbered
interface of the trunk.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system also uses the lowest-numbered interface of a trunk as
a reference link. The BIG-IP system uses the reference link to take
certain aggregation actions, such as implementing the automatic link
selection policy. For frames coming into the reference link, the BIG-IP
system load balances the frames across all member links that the BIG-IP
system knows to be available. For frames going from any link in the
trunk to a destination host, the BIG-IP system treats those frames as if
they came from the reference link.</p>
<p>Finally, the BIG-IP system uses the MAC address of an individual member
link as the source address for any LACP control frames.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of LACP</strong></p>
<p>A key aspect of trunks is Link Aggregation Control Protocol, or LACP.
Defined by IEEE standard 802.3ad, LACP is a protocol that detects error
conditions on member links and redistributes traffic to other member
links, thus preventing any loss of traffic on the failed link. On a
BIG-IP system, LACP is an optional feature that you can configure.</p>
<p>You can also customize LACP behavior. For example, you can specify the
way that LACP communicates its control messages from the BIG-IP system
to a peer system. You can also specify the rate at which the peer system
sends LACP packets to the BIG-IP system. If you want to affect the way
that the BIG-IP system chooses links for link aggregation, you can
specify a link control policy.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p>An IP address is an address used in order to uniquely identify a device
on an IP network. The address is made up of 32 binary bits, which can be
divisible into a network portion and host portion with the help of a
subnet mask. The 32 binary bits are broken into four octets (1 octet = 8
bits). Each octet is converted to decimal and separated by a period
(dot). For this reason, an IP address is expressed in dotted decimal
format (for example, 172.16.81.100). The value in each octet ranges from
0 to 255 decimal, or 00000000 - 11111111 binary.</p>
<p>Here is how binary octets convert to decimal: The right most bit, or
least significant bit, of an octet holds a value of 2^0. The bit just to
the left of that holds a value of 2^1. This continues until the
left-most bit, or most significant bit, which holds a value of 2^7. So
if all binary bits were a one, the decimal equivalent would be 255 as
shown here:</p>

<p>These octets are broken down to provide an addressing scheme that can
accommodate large and small networks. There are five different classes
of networks, A to E. This document focuses on addressing classes A to C,
since classes D and E are reserved and discussion of them is beyond the
scope of this document.</p>
<p><em>Note - Also note that the terms âClass A, Class B and so onâ are used in this document to help facilitate the understanding of IP addressing and subnetting. These terms are rarely used in the industry anymore because of the introduction of classless inter-domain routing (CIDR), although CIDR is beyond the scope of this document. Given an IP address, its class can be determined from the three high-order bits. The Figure below shows the significance of the three high order bits and the range of addresses that fall into each class. For informational purposes, Class D and Class E addresses are also shown.</em></p>

<p><strong>Network Masks</strong></p>
<p>A network mask helps you know which portion of the address identifies
the network and which portion of the address identifies the node. Class
A, B, and C networks have default masks, also known as natural masks, as
shown here:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Class C:</td>
<td>255.255.255.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>An IP address on a Class A network that has not been subnetted would
have an address/mask pair similar to: 8.20.15.1 255.0.0.0. To see how
the mask helps you identify the network and node parts of the address,
convert the address and mask to binary numbers.</p>
<p>8.20.15.1 = 00001000.00010100.00001111.00000001 255.0.0.0 =
11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000</p>
<p>Once you have the address and the mask represented in binary, then
identifying the network and host ID is easier. Any address bits that
have corresponding mask bits set to 1 represent the network ID. Any
address bits that have corresponding mask bits set to 0 represent the
node ID.</p>

<p>Understanding Subnetting</p>
<p>Subnetting allows you to create multiple logical networks that exist
within a single Class A, B, or C network. If you do not subnet, you are
only able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network, which
is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Each data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every
node on that link being a member of the same network. If you break a
major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnets, it allows you to
create a network of interconnecting subnets. Each data link on this
network would then have a unique network/sub-network ID. Any device, or
gateway, connecting n networks/subnets has n distinct IP addresses, one
for each network / sub-network that it interconnects. In order to subnet
a network, extend the natural mask using some of the bits from the host
ID portion of the address to create a sub-network ID. For example, given
a Class C network of 204.17.5.0, which has a natural mask of
255.255.255.0, you can create subnets in this manner:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<td>â-| sub |</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>By extending the mask to be 255.255.255.224, you have taken three bits
(indicated by âsubâ) from the original host portion of the address and
used them to make subnets. With these three bits, it is possible to
create eight subnets. With the remaining five host ID bits, each subnet
can have up to 32 host addresses, 30 of which can actually be assigned
to a device since host ids of all zeros or all ones are not allowed (it
is very important to remember this). So, with this in mind, these
subnets have been created.</p>

<p><em>Note:
There are two ways to denote these masks. First, since you are using three bits more than the ânaturalâ Class C mask, you can denote these addresses as having a 3-bit subnet mask. Or, secondly, the mask of 255.255.255.224 can also be denoted as /27 as there are 27 bits that are set in the mask. This second method is used with CIDR. With this method, one of these networks can be described with the notation pre-fix/length. For example, 204.17.5.32/27 denotes the network 204.17.5.32 255.255.255.224. When appropriate the prefix/length notation is used to denote the mask throughout the rest of this document.</em></p>
<p>The network subnetting scheme in this section allows for eight subnets,
and the network might appear as:</p>

<p>Notice that each of the routers in the figure is attached to four
subnets, one sub-network is common to both routers. Also, each router
has an IP address for each subnets to which it is attached. Each
sub-network could potentially support up to 30 host addresses.</p>
<p>This brings up an interesting point. The more host bits you use for a
subnet mask, the more subnets you have available. However, the more
subnets available, the less host addresses available per subnet. For
example, a Class C network of 204.17.5.0 and a mask of 255.255.255.224
(/27) allows you to have eight subnets, each with 32 host addresses (30
of which could be assigned to devices). If you use a mask of
255.255.255.240 (/28), the break down is:</p>

<p>Since you now have four bits to make subnets with, you only have four
bits left for host addresses. So in this case you can have up to 16
subnets, each of which can have up to 16 host addresses (14 of which can
be assigned to devices).</p>
<p>Take a look at how a Class B network might be subnetted. If you have
network 172.16.0.0, then you know that its natural mask is 255.255.0.0
or 172.16.0.0/16. Extending the mask to anything beyond 255.255.0.0
means you are subnetting. You can quickly see that you have the ability
to create a lot more subnets than with the Class C network. If you use a
mask of 255.255.248.0 (/21), how many subnets and hosts per subnet does
this allow for?</p>

<p>You are using five bits from the original host bits for subnets. This
allows you to have 32 subnets (2^5). After using the five bits for
subnetting, you are left with 11 bits for host addresses. This allows
each subnet so have 2048 host addresses (2^11), 2046 of which could be
assigned to devices.</p>
<p><em>Note -
In the past, there were limitations to the use of a subnet 0 (all subnet bits are set to zero) and all ones subnet (all subnet bits set to one). Some devices would not allow the use of these subnets. Cisco Systems devices allow the use of these subnets when the IP subnet zero command is configured.</em></p>
<p>A broadcast address is an IP address that targets all systems on a
specific subnet instead of single hosts. The broadcast address of any IP
address can be calculated by taking the bit compliment of the subnet
mask, sometimes referred to as the reverse mask, and then applying it
with a bitwise OR calculation to the IP address in question.</p>

<p>Some systems that are derived from BSD use zeros broadcasts instead of
ones-broadcasts. This means that when a broadcast address is created,
the host area of the IP address is filled while displayed using binary
values with zeros instead of ones. Most operating systems use ones
broadcasts. Changing systems to use zeros-broadcasts will break some
communications in the wrong environments, so the user should understand
his/her needs before changing the broadcast address or type.</p>
<p><strong>Math Example</strong></p>
<p>If a system has the IP address 192.168.12.220 and a network mask of
255.255.255.128, what should the broadcast address for the system be? To
do this calculation, convert all numbers to binary values. For bitwise,
remember that any two values where at least one value is 1, the result
will be 1, otherwise the result is 0.</p>

<p><strong>Route Tables</strong></p>
<p>Every computer that runs TCP/IP makes routing decisions. The IP routing
table controls these decisions. To display the IP routing table on
computers running Windows Server 2003 operating systems, you can type
âroute printâ at a command prompt.</p>
<p>The following table shows an example of an IP routing table. This
example is for a computer running Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition
with one 10 megabit per second (Mbit/s) network adapter and the
following configuration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>IP address: 10.0.0.169</li>
<li>Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0</li>
<li>Default gateway: 10.0.0.1</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/1p9.png" src="../../_images/1p9.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>The routing table is built automatically, based on the current TCP/IP
configuration of your computer. Each route occupies a single line in the
displayed table. Your computer searches the routing table for an entry
that most closely matches the destination IP address.</p>
<p>Your computer uses the default route if no other host or network route
matches the destination address included in an IP datagram. The default
route typically forwards an IP datagram (for which there is no matching
or explicit local route) to a default gateway address for a router on
the local subnet. In the previous example, the default route forwards
the datagram to a router with a gateway address of 10.0.0.1.</p>
<p>Because the router that corresponds to the default gateway contains
information about the network IDs of the other IP subnets within the
larger TCP/IP Internet, it forwards the datagram to other routers until
the datagram is eventually delivered to an IP router that is connected
to the specified destination host or subnet within the larger network.</p>
<p>The following sections describe each of the columns displayed in the IP
routing table: network destination, netmask, gateway, interface, and
metric.</p>
<p><strong>Network destination</strong></p>
<p>The network destination is used with the netmask to match the
destination IP address. The network destination can range from 0.0.0.0
for the default route through 255.255.255.255 for the limited broadcast,
which is a special broadcast address to all hosts on the same network
segment.</p>
<p><strong>Gateway</strong></p>
<p>The gateway address is the IP address that the local host uses to
forward IP datagrams to other IP networks. This is either the IP address
of a local network adapter or the IP address of an IP router (such as a
default gateway router) on the local network segment.</p>
<p>Interface</p>
<p>The interface is the IP address that is configured on the local computer
for the local network adapter that is used when an IP datagram is
forwarded on the network.</p>
<p><strong>Metric</strong></p>
<p>A metric indicates the cost of using a route, which is typically the
number of hops to the IP destination. Anything on the local subnet is
one hop, and each router crossed after that is an additional hop. If
there are multiple routes to the same destination with different
metrics, the route with the lowest metric is selected.</p>

<p><strong>1.03 - Explain the purpose and functionality of Routing protocols</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.orbit-computer-solutions.com/Routing-Protocols.php">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Routing Protocols</strong></p>
<p>A routing protocol is a set of rules or standard that determines how
routers on a network communicate and exchange information with each
other, enabling them to select best routes to a remote network. Each
router has priority knowledge only of networks attached to it directly.
A router running routing protocol shares this information first, among
immediate neighbors, then throughout the entire network. This way,
routers gain insight knowledge of the topology of the network.</p>
<p>Routing protocols perform several activities, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Network discovery</li>
<li>Updating and maintaining routing tables</li>
</ul>
<p>The router that sits at the base of a network maintains a routing table,
which is a list of networks and possible routes known by the router. The
routing table includes network addresses for its own interfaces, which
are the directly connected networks, as well as network addresses for
remote networks. A remote network is a network that can only be reached
by forwarding the packet to another router.</p>
<p>Remote networks are added to the routing table in two ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>By the network administrator manually configuring static routes.</li>
<li>By implementing a dynamic routing protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Routers use Dynamic Routing protocols to share information about the
reachability and status of remote networks.</p>
<p><strong>IP Routing Protocols (Dynamic)</strong></p>
<p>There are several dynamic routing protocols for IP. Here are some of the
more common dynamic routing protocols for routing IP packets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>RIP (Routing Information Protocol)</li>
<li>IGRP (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)</li>
<li>EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)</li>
<li>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)</li>
<li>IS-IS (Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System)</li>
<li>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages of dynamic routing protocols</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dynamic routing protocols update and maintain the networks in their
routing tables.</li>
<li>Dynamic routing protocols not only make a best path determination to
various networks, they will also determine a new best path if the
initial path becomes unusable or there is a change in the topology.</li>
<li>Routers that use dynamic routing protocols automatically share
routing information with other routers and compensate for any
topology changes without involving the network administrator.</li>

<p><strong>1.03 - Explain the purpose of fragmentation</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_fragmentation">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Why does fragmentation occur?</strong></p>
<p>Fragmentation happens when a large IP datagram has to travel through a
network with a maximum transmission unit (MTU) that is smaller than the
size of the IP datagram. If an IP datagram that is bigger than 1500
bytes (typical MTU size) is sent on an Ethernet network, the datagram
needs to be fragmented prior to being placed on the network. The network
packets are then assembled at the receiving host. Fragmentation can
happen at either at the origination host or at an intermediate router.</p>
<p>IP fragmentation can cause excessive retransmissions when fragments
encounter packet loss and reliable protocols such as TCP must retransmit
all of the fragments in order to recover from the loss of a single
fragment.[4] Thus, senders typically use two approaches to decide the
size of IP datagrams to send over the network. The first is for the
sending host to send an IP datagram of size equal to the MTU of the
first hop of the source destination pair. The second is to run the path
MTU discovery algorithm,[5] described in RFC 1191, to determine the path
MTU between two IP hosts, so that IP fragmentation can be avoided.</p>

<p><strong>1.03 - Given a fragment, identify what information is needed for
reassembly</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://news.hitb.org/content/understanding-ip-fragmentation">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>How are the packets reassembled?</strong></p>
<p>Note that with IP fragmentation, packets are not reassembled until they
reach the final destination. It is reassembled at the IP layer at the
receiving end. This is make fragmentation and reassembly transparent to
the protocol layer (TCP and UDP). If one of the packets is lost, the
whole packets need to be transmitted again. Packets are reassembled at
the receiving host by associating each fragment with an identical
fragment identification number, or frag id for short. The frag ID is
actually a copy of the ID field (IP identification number) in the IP
header. Besides that, each fragment must carry its âpositionâ or
âoffsetâ in the original unfragmented packet. Thus the first fragment
will have an offset of 0, since its seat is at the front row and
counting starts from 0. Each fragment must also tell the length of data
that it carries. This is like the compartments in a train. And finally,
each fragment must flag the MF (more fragments) bit if it is not the
last fragment.</p>
<p><strong>Fragmenting a Packet</strong></p>
<p>Here is a hypothetical example. Suppose that we want to send a 110 bytes
ICMP packet on a network with MTU of 40 (well thatâs damn small, but
this is for illustration purposes). This is a diagram of the original
packet:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<p>ID - IP identification number</p>
<p>Len - Data Length (data length does not include IP header)</p>
<p>Off - Offset</p>
<p>MF - More Fragment</p>
<p>Notice that the second packet and subsequent packets contains IP header
that is copied from the original packet. There are no ICMP headers,
except in the first packet. In a nutshell, the 110 ICMP packet is broke
into 5 packet, with total lengths of 40, 40, 40, 40 and 30 bytes each.
The ICMP data is broken into lengths of 12, 20, 20, 20, and 10 bytes
each.</p>

<p><strong>1.03 - Explain the purpose of TTL functionality</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>TTL</strong></p>
<p>TTL may be implemented as a counter or timestamp attached to or embedded
in the data. Once the prescribed event count or timespan has elapsed,
data is discarded. In computer networking, TTL prevents a data packet
from circulating indefinitely. In computing applications, TTL is used to
improve performance of caching or to improve privacy.</p>
<p>Under the Internet Protocol, TTL is an 8-bit field. In the IPv4 header,
TTL is the 9th octet of 20. In the IPv6 header, it is the 8th octet of
40. The maximum TTL value is 255, the maximum value of a single octet. A
recommended initial value is 64.</p>
<p>The time-to-live value can be thought of as an upper bound on the time
that an IP datagram can exist in an Internet system. The TTL field is
set by the sender of the datagram, and reduced by every router on the
route to its destination. If the TTL field reaches zero before the
datagram arrives at its destination, then the datagram is discarded and
an ICMP error datagram (11 - Time Exceeded) is sent back to the sender.
The purpose of the TTL field is to avoid a situation in which an
undeliverable datagram keeps circulating on an Internet system, and such
a system eventually becoming swamped by such âimmortalsâ.</p>
<p>In theory, under IPv4, time to live is measured in seconds, although
every host that passes the datagram must reduce the TTL by at least one
unit. In practice, the TTL field is reduced by one with every hop. To
reflect this practice, the field is renamed hop limit in IPv6.</p>

<p><strong>1.03 - Given a packet traversing a topology, document the

<p><strong>Packet Traversing a Topology</strong></p>
<p>If Host A wants to talk to host B on the network and there are multiple
routed networks between the two devices, can you describe the changes to
the packet will look like as it passes through each network device?</p>
<p>Here is an example network and we will discuss the process of the packet
traversing the network below.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<img alt="../../_images/1p10.png" src="../../_images/1p10.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>So as Host A attempts to communicate to Host B (via an application like
a browser) this will either be a connection based on a DNS name or an IP
address. If it is DNS name, it will resolve the host name to an IP
address or if not, it will use the known IP address in the browser path.
The operating system will look to see if Host B is on it own local IP
subnet. If it were it would look in itâs ARP cache to see if it has an
entry for Host Bâs IP address. Since Host B is not on its local IP
subnet it will send the traffic to itâs default gateway. The packet will
not be destined for the IP of the default gateway (in this case Router
Aâs IP on the green subnet) but it will look in ARP cache for the MAC
address of the gateway and the packet will look like this as it leaves
Host A:</p>
<p>Src MAC = Host A</p>
<p>Dest MAC = DGW Router A</p>
<p>Src IP = Host A</p>
<p>Dest IP = Host B</p>
<p>The default gateway will receive the packet and will process it since it
is destine for its MAC Address. Router A will send the packet to the
next hop router within the network (based on static routes or routes via
routing protocols) and the packet will look like the following:</p>
<p>Src MAC = Router A</p>
<p>Dest MAC = Router B</p>
<p>Src IP = Host A</p>
<p>Dest IP = Host B</p>
<p>Router B will receive the packet and will process it since it is destine
for its MAC Address. Router B will send the packet to the next hop
router within the network and the packet will look like the following:</p>
<p>Src MAC = Router B</p>
<p>Dest MAC = Router C</p>
<p>Src IP = Host A</p>
<p>Dest IP = Host B</p>
<p>Router C will receive the packet and will process it since it is destine
for its MAC Address. Router C will See that the destination IP is on a
locally attached subnet and will check its ARP Cache for the MAC address
of Host Bâs IP address. If it has a known MAC Address it will use it and
if it does not it will ARP for the IP to add the entry to itâs ARP
table. Once it knows the MAC address it will send on the packet that
will look like the following:</p>
<p>Src MAC = Router C</p>
<p>Dest MAC = Host B</p>
<p>Src IP = Host A</p>
<p>Dest IP = Host B</p>

<p><strong>1.03 - IP version 6 (not in depth on exam)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsp/article.php/3633211/Understand-IPv6-Addresses.htm">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>IPv6</strong></p>
<p>Increasing the IP address pool was one of the major forces behind
developing IPv6. It uses a 128-bit address, meaning that we have a
maximum of 2128 addresses available, or
340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456, or enough to give
multiple IP addresses to every grain of sand on the planet. So our
friendly old 32-bit IPv4 dotted-quads donât do the job anymore; these
newfangled IPs require eight 16-bit hexadecimal colon-delimited blocks.
So not only are they longer, they use numbers and letters. At first
glance, those huge IPv6 addresses look like impenetrable secret code:</p>
<p>2001:0db8:3c4d:0015:0000:0000:abcd:ef12</p>
<p>Weâll dissect this in a moment and learn thatâs it not such a scary
thing, but first letâs look at the different types of IPv6 addressing.</p>
<p>Under IPv4 we have the old familiar unicast, broadcast and multicast
addresses. In IPv6 we have unicast, multicast and anycast. With IPv6 the
broadcast addresses are not used anymore, because they are replaced with
multicast addressing.</p>
<p><strong>IPv6 Unicast</strong></p>
<p>This is similar to the unicast address in IPv4 - a single address
identifying a single interface. There are four types of unicast
addresses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Global unicast addresses, which are conventional, publicly routable
address, just like conventional IPv4 publicly routable addresses.</li>
<li>Link-local addresses are akin to the private, non-routable addresses
in IPv4 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16). They are not
meant to be routed, but confined to a single network segment.
Link-local addresses mean you can easily throw together a temporary
LAN, such as for conferences or meetings, or set up a permanent small
LAN the easy way.</li>
<li>Unique local addresses are also meant for private addressing, with
the addition of being unique, so that joining two subnets does not
cause address collisions.</li>
<li>Special addresses are loopback addresses, IPv4-address mapped spaces,
and 6-to-4 addresses for crossing from an IPv4 network to an IPv6
network.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you read about site-local IPv6 addresses, which are related to
link-local, these have been deprecated, so you donât need to bother with
them.</p>
<p><strong>Multicast</strong></p>
<p>Multicast in IPv6 is similar to the old IPv4 broadcast address a packet
sent to a multicast address is delivered to every interface in a group.
The IPv6 difference is itâs targeted instead of annoying every single
host on the segment with broadcast blather, only hosts who are members
of the multicast group receive the multicast packets. IPv6 multicast is
routable, and routers will not forward multicast packets unless there
are members of the multicast groups to forward the packets to. Anyone
who has ever suffered from broadcast storms will appreciate this
mightily.</p>
<p><strong>Anycast</strong></p>
<p>An anycast address is a single address assigned to multiple nodes. A
packet sent to an anycast address is then delivered to the first
available node. This is a slick way to provide both load-balancing and
automatic failover. The idea of anycast has been around for a long time;
it was proposed for inclusion in IPv4 but it never happened.</p>
<p>Several of the DNS root servers use a router-based anycast
implementation, which is really a shared unicast addressing scheme.
(While there are only thirteen authoritative root server names, the
total number of actual servers is considerably larger, and they are
spread all over the globe.) The same IP address is assigned to multiple
interfaces, and then multiple routing tables entries are needed to move
everything along.</p>
<p>IPv6 anycast addresses contain fields that identify them as anycast, so
all you need to do is configure your network interfaces appropriately.
The IPv6 protocol itself takes care of getting the packets to their
final destinations. Itâs a lot simpler to administer than shared unicast
addressing.</p>
<p><strong>Address Dissection</strong></p>
<p>Letâs take another look at our example IPv6 address:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">2001:0db8:3c4d:0015:0000:0000:abcd:ef12</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>_______________|____|______________</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>global   prefix  subnet  Interface ID</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The prefix identifies it as a global unicast address. It has three
parts: the network identifier, the subnet, and the interface identifier.</p>
<p>The global routing prefix comes from a pool assigned to you, either by
direct assignment from a Regional Internet Registry like APNIC, ARIN, or
RIPE NCC, or more likely from your Internet service provider. The local
network administrator controls the subnet and interface IDs.</p>
<p>Youâll probably be running mixed IPv6/IPv4 networks for some time. IPv6
addresses must have 128 bits. IPv4 addresses are therefore represented
like this:</p>

<p>Eight blocks of 16 bits each are required in an IPv6 address. The IPv4

<p><strong>1.04 - Compare/Contrast purpose and functionality of MTU and MSS</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://compnetworking.about.com/od/networkprotocols/g/mtu-maximum.htm">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>MTU</strong></p>
<p>The MTU is the maximum size of a single data unit (e.g., a frame) of
digital communications. MTU sizes are inherent properties of physical
network interfaces, normally measured in bytes. The MTU for Ethernet,
for instance, is 1500 bytes. Some types of networks (like Token Ring)
have larger MTUs, and some types have smaller MTUs, but the values are
fixed for each physical technology.</p>
<p>Higher-level network protocols like TCP/IP can be configured with a
maximum packet size, a parameter independent of the physical layer MTU
over which TCP/IP runs. Unfortunately, many network devices use the
terms interchangeably. On both home broadband routers and Xbox Live
enabled game consoles, for example, the parameter called MTU is in fact
the maximum TCP packet size and not the physical MTU.</p>
<p>In Microsoft Windows, the maximum packet size for protocols like TCP can
be set in the Registry. If this value is set too low, streams of network
traffic will be broken up into a relatively large number of small
packets that adversely affects performance. Xbox Live, for example,
requires the value of MTU (packet size) by at least 1365 bytes. If the
maximum TCP packet size is set too high, it will exceed the networkâs
physical MTU and also degrade performance by requiring that each packet
be subdivided into smaller ones (a process known as fragmentation).
Microsoft Windows computers default to a maximum packet size of 1500
bytes for broadband connections and 576 bytes for dialup connections.</p>
<p>Performance problems may also occur if the TCP âMTUâ setting on the home
broadband router differs from the setting on individual devices
connected to it.</p>

<p><strong>MSS</strong></p>
<p>During session connection establishment, two peers, or hosts, engage in
negotiations to determine the IP segment size of packets that they will
exchange during their communication. The segment size is based on the
MSS option (maximum segment size) value set in the TCP SYN (synchronize)
packets that the peers exchange during session negotiation. The MSS
field value to be used is largely determined by the maximum transmission
unit (MTU) of the interfaces that the peers are directly connected to.</p>
<p><strong>About TCP and MSS</strong></p>
<p>The TCP protocol is designed to limit the size of segments of data to a
maximum of number of bytes. The purpose for this is to constrain the
need to fragment segments of data for transmission at the IP level. The
TCP MSS specifies the maximum number of bytes that a TCP packetâs data
field, or segment, can contain. It refers to the maximum amount of TCP
data in a single IP datagram that the local system can accept and
reassemble.</p>
<p>A TCP packet includes data for headers as well as data contained in the
segment. If the MSS value is set too low, the result is inefficient use
of bandwidth; more packets are required to transmit the data. An MSS
value that is set too high could result in an IP datagram that is too
large to send and that must be fragmented.</p>
<p>Typically a host bases its MSS value on its outgoing interfaceâs maximum
transmission unit (MTU) size. The MTU is the maximum frame size along
the path between peers. A packet is fragmented when it exceeds the MTU
size. Because of variation of the MTU size of the interfaces of hosts in
the path taken by TCP packets between two peers, some packets that are
within the negotiated MSS size of the two peers might be fragmented but
instead are dropped and an ICMP error message is sent to the source host
of the packet.</p>
<p>To diminish the likelihood of fragmentation and to protect against
packet loss, you can decrease the TCP MSS.</p>

<p><strong>1.04 - Explain the purpose and functionality of TCP</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.linktionary.com/t/tcp.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>TCP</strong></p>
<p>TCP is a subset of the Internet protocol suite, which is often called
TCP/IP, although the acronym TCP/IP refers to only two of the many
protocols in the Internet protocol suite. Still, most people refer to
the Internet protocols as TCP/IP and that style is retained here.</p>
<p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides the flow controls
and reliable data delivery services listed next. These services run in
the host computers at either end of a connection, not in the network
itself. Therefore, TCP is a protocol for managing end-to-end
connections. Since end-to-end connections may exist across a series of
point-to-point connections, they are often called virtual circuits.</p>

</table>
<p>Reliable data delivery services are critical for applications such as
file transfers, database services, transaction processing, and other
mission-critical applications in which every packet must be
delivered-guaranteed.</p>
<p>While TCP provides these reliable services, it depends on IP to delivery
packets. IP is often referred to as an unreliable or best effort
service. While it seems odd to build a network that is unreliable, the
original Internet architects wanted to remove as many services from the
network itself to support fast packet delivery rather than reliability.
Routers do not keep track of packets or do anything to ensure delivery.
They just forward packets.</p>
<p>The assumption was that end systems would be relatively smart devices
with memory and processors. The end devices could handle all the
reliability functions rather than the network. This was actually a
radical approach at the time, but the implications have been profound.
It meant that end systems would become the focus of application
development for the Internet, not the network.</p>
<p>In contrast, the telephone network implements an architecture in which
end devices (phones) are dumb and the network is supposedly âsmart.â The
only problem with this model is that you canât run applications on your
phone that takes advantage of the network. In fact, you are totally
dependent on the phone company to deploy new applications (call waiting
and caller ID are examples). Compared to the Internet, the phone system
is a dinosaur. Consider that the user interface for the Web is a
full-color graphical browser, while the interface for the telephone
network is a 12-key pad!</p>
<p>While end-systems provide TCPâs reliability functions, not all
applications need them. For example, there is no need to recover lost
packets in a live video stream. By the time they are recovered, the
viewer has already seen the barely visible glitch caused by the missing
packet. These applications just need speed. So UDP was created to
provide an application interface to the network for real-time
applications that donât need TCPâs extra services. UDP provides a very
simple port connection between applications and IP.</p>
<p><strong>TCP Three-way handshake</strong></p>
<p>A TCP Three-way handshake is a method of initializing a Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) session between two hosts on a TCP/IP network.
The handshake establishes a logical connection between the hosts by
synchronizing the sending and receiving of packets and communicating TCP
parameters between the hosts.</p>
<p><strong>How the TCP Three-way Handshake works</strong></p>
<p>All TCP communication is connection oriented. A TCP session must be
established before the hosts in the connection exchange data. Packets
that are transferred between hosts are accounted for by assigning a
sequence number to each packet. An ACK, or acknowledgment, is sent after
every packet is received. If no ACK is received for a packet, the packet
is re-sent. The three-way handshake ensures that the initial request is
acknowledged, that the data is sent, and that the data is acknowledged.</p>
<p><strong>These are the three stages of a TCP three-way handshake:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The initiating host sends a TCP packet requesting a new session. This
packet contains the initiating hostâs sequence number for the
connection. The packet includes information such as a set SYN
(synchronization) flag and data about the size of the window buffer
on the initiating host.</li>
<li>The target host sends a TCP packet with its own sequence number and
an ACK of the initiating hostâs sequence number.</li>
<li>The initiating host sends an ACK containing the target sequence
number that it received.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note - A similar three-way process is used to terminate a TCP session between two hosts. Using the same type of handshake to end the connection ensures that the hosts have completed their transactions and that all data is accounted for.</em></p>

<p><strong>1.04 - Explain the purpose and functionality of UDP</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.jguru.com/faq/view.jsp?EID=9472">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>UDP</strong></p>
<p>UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. UDP provides an unreliable packet
delivery system built on top of the IP protocol. As with IP, each packet
is individual and is handled separately. Because of this, the amount of
data that can be sent in a UDP packet is limited to the amount that can
be contained in a single IP packet. Thus, a UDP packet can contain at
most 65507 bytes (this is the 65535-byte IP packet size minus the
minimum IP header of 20 bytes and minus the 8-byte UDP header).</p>
<p>UDP packets can arrive out of order or not at all. No packet has any
knowledge of the preceding or following packet. The recipient does not
acknowledge packets, so the sender does not know that the transmission
was successful. UDP has no provisions for flow controlâpackets can be
received faster than they can be used. We call this type of
communication connectionless because the packets have no relationship to
each other and because there is no state maintained.</p>
<p>The destination IP address and port number are encapsulated in each UDP
packet. These two numbers together uniquely identify the recipient and
are used by the underlying operating system to deliver the packet to a
specific process (application). Each UDP packet also contains the
senderâs IP address and port number.</p>
<p>One way to think of UDP is by analogy to communications via a letter.
You write the letter (this is the data you are sending); put the letter
inside an envelope (the UDP packet); address the envelope (using an IP
address and a port number); put your return address on the envelope
(your local IP address and port number); and then you send the letter.</p>
<p>Like a real letter, you have no way of knowing whether a UDP packet was
received. If you send a second letter one day after the first, the
second one may be received before the first. Or, the second one may
never be received.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/internet-infrastructure10.htm">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Protocol Ports</strong></p>
<p>In TCP/IP and UDP networks, a port is an endpoint to a logical
connection and the way a client program specifies a specific server
program on a computer in a network. There are 65535 available ports per
IP address and many of these ports are reserved as well known
application ports.</p>
<p>A server makes its services available using numbered ports; one for each
service that is available on the server. For example, if a server
machine is running a Web server and a file transfer protocol (FTP)
server, the Web server would typically be available on port 80, and the
FTP server would be available on port 21. Clients connect to a service
at a specific IP address and on a specific port number.</p>
<p>Once a client has connected to a service on a particular port, it
accesses the service using a specific protocol. Protocols are often text
and simply describe how the client and server will have their
conversation. Every Web server on the Internet conforms to the hypertext
transfer protocol (HTTP).</p>

<p><strong>1.04 - Explain how retransmissions occur</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Development">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>TCP Timeout and Retransmission</strong></p>
<p>The Transmission Control Protocol provides a communication service at an
intermediate level between an application program and the Internet
Protocol. It provides host-to-host connectivity at the Transport Layer
of the Internet model. An application does not need to know the
particular mechanisms for sending data via a link to another host, such
as the required packet fragmentation on the transmission medium. At the
transport layer, the protocol handles all handshaking and transmission
details and presents an abstraction of the network connection to the
application.</p>
<p>At the lower levels of the protocol stack, due to network congestion,
traffic load balancing, or other unpredictable network behavior, IP
packets may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order. TCP detects
these problems, requests retransmission of lost data, rearranges
out-of-order data, and even helps minimize network congestion to reduce
the occurrence of the other problems. If the data still remains
undelivered, its source is notified of this failure. Once the TCP
receiver has reassembled the sequence of octets originally transmitted,
it passes them to the receiving application. Thus, TCP abstracts the
applicationâs communication from the underlying networking details.</p>
<p>TCP is a reliable stream delivery service that guarantees that all bytes
received will be identical with bytes sent and in the correct order.
Since packet transfer over many networks is not reliable, a technique
known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to
guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique
requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it
receives the data. The sender keeps a record of each packet it sends.
The sender also maintains a timer from when the packet was sent, and
retransmits a packet if the timer expires before the message has been
acknowledged. The timer is needed in case a packet gets lost or
corrupted.</p>
<p>While IP handles actual delivery of the data, TCP keeps track of the
individual units of data transmission, called segments, which a message
is divided into for efficient routing through the network. For example,
when an HTML file is sent from a web server, the TCP software layer of
that server divides the sequence of octets of the file into segments and
forwards them individually to the IP software layer (Internet Layer).
The Internet Layer encapsulates each TCP segment into an IP packet by
adding a header that includes (among other data) the destination IP
address. When the client program on the destination computer receives
them, the TCP layer (Transport Layer) reassembles the individual
segments and ensures they are correctly ordered and error free as it
streams them to an application.</p>

<p><strong>What are TCP RST Packets?</strong></p>
<p>According to RFC 793, which specifies an Option in the Flags portion of
the TCP header called Reset (or RST). The Reset bit is designed to allow
a station to abort the TCP connection with another station. This can
happen for a number of reasons.</p>

</div>
<p>If a station involved in a TCP session notices that it is not receiving
acknowledgements for anything it sends, the connection is now
unsynchronized, and the station should send a reset. This is a half-open
connection where only one side is involved in the TCP session. This
cannot work by definition of the protocol.</p>
<p>RST packets are a sign that the TCP connections are half open. One
station or the other stopped sending information or ACKs for some
reason. There are acceptable times for RST packets, however, if there
are a large number of RST packets in a conversation, this is definitely
something to troubleshoot. Which side is sending the RST? What is
causing it to send the RST? Does this happen right away in the TCP
setup, or is it later in the session? If later, is there any reason that
the station would abort the session in the middle of the data transfer?</p>

<p><strong>1.04 - Describe various TCP options</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Development">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>TCP Options</strong></p>
<p>The length of this field is determined by the data offset field. Options
have up to three fields: Option-Kind (1 byte), Option-Length (1 byte),
Option-Data (variable). The Option-Kind field indicates the type of
option, and is the only field that is not optional. Depending on what
kind of option we are dealing with, the next two fields may be set: the
Option-Length field indicates the total length of the option, and the
Option-Data field contains the value of the option, if applicable. For
example, an Option-Kind byte of 0x01 indicates that this is a No-Op
option used only for padding, and does not have an Option-Length or
Option-Data byte following it. An Option-Kind byte of 0 is the End Of
Options option, and is also only one byte. An Option-Kind byte of 0x02
indicates that this is the Maximum Segment Size option, and will be
followed by a byte specifying the length of the MSS field (should be
0x04). Note that this length is the total length of the given options
field, including Option-Kind and Option-Length bytes. So while the MSS
value is typically expressed in two bytes, the length of the field will
be 4 bytes (+2 bytes of kind and length). In short, an MSS option field
with a value of 0x05B4 will show up as (0x02 0x04 0x05B4) in the TCP
options section.</p>
<p>Some options may only be sent when SYN is set. Option-Kind and standard

<p><strong>1.04 - Describe a TCP checksum error</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPChecksumCalculationandtheTCPPseudoHeader.htm">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>TCP Checksum</strong></p>
<p>The Transmission Control Protocol is designed to provide reliable data
transfer between a pair of devices on an IP internetwork. Much of the
effort required to ensure reliable delivery of data segments is of
necessity focused on the problem of ensuring that data is not lost in
transit. But thereâs another important critical impediment to the safe
transmission of data: the risk of errors being introduced into a TCP
segment during its travel across the internetwork.</p>
<p><strong>Detecting Transmission Errors Using Checksums</strong></p>
<p>If the data gets where it needs to go but is corrupted and we do not
detect the corruption, this is in some ways worse than it never showing
up at all. To provide basic protection against errors in transmission,
TCP includes a 16-bit Checksum field in its header. The idea behind a
checksum is very straightforward: take a string of data bytes and add
them all together. Then send this sum with the data stream and have the
receiver check the sum. In TCP, a special algorithm is used to calculate
this checksum by the device sending the segment; the same algorithm is
then employed by the recipient to check the data it received and ensure
that there were no errors.</p>
<p>The checksum calculation used by TCP is a bit different than a regular
checksum algorithm. A conventional checksum is performed over all the
bytes that the checksum is intended to protect, and can detect most bit
errors in any of those fields. The designers of TCP wanted this bit
error protection, but also desired to protect against other type of
problems.</p>

<p><strong>1.04 - Describe how TCP addresses error correction</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Checksum_computation">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>TCP Error Correction</strong></p>
<p>Sequence numbers allow receivers to discard duplicate packets and
properly sequence reordered packets. Acknowledgments allow senders to
determine when to retransmit lost packets.</p>
<p>To assure correctness a checksum field is included. When TCP runs over
IPv4, the method used to compute the checksum is defined in RFC 793. The
TCP checksum is a weak check by modern standards. Data Link Layers with
high bit error rates may require additional link error
correction/detection capabilities. The weak checksum is partially
compensated for by the common use of a CRC or better integrity check at
layer 2, below both TCP and IP, such as is used in PPP or the Ethernet
frame. However, this does not mean that the 16-bit TCP checksum is
redundant: remarkably, introduction of errors in packets between
CRC-protected hops is common, but the end-to-end 16-bit TCP checksum
catches most of these simple errors. This is the end-to-end principle at
work.</p>

<p><strong>1.04 - Describe how the flow control process occurs</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Flow_control">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Flow Control</strong></p>
<p>TCP uses an end-to-end flow control protocol to avoid having the sender
send data too fast for the TCP receiver to receive and process it
reliably. Having a mechanism for flow control is essential in an
environment where machines of diverse network speeds communicate. For
example, if a PC sends data to a smartphone that is slowly processing
received data, the smartphone must regulate the data flow so as not to
be overwhelmed.</p>
<p>TCP uses a sliding window flow control protocol. In each TCP segment,
the receiver specifies in the receive window field the amount of
additionally received data (in bytes) that it is willing to buffer for
the connection. The sending host can send only up to that amount of data
before it must wait for an acknowledgment and window update from the
receiving host.</p>
<p>TCP sequence numbers and receive windows behave very much like a clock.
The receive window shifts each time the receiver receives and
acknowledges a new segment of data. Once it runs out of sequence
numbers, the sequence number loops back to 0.</p>
<p>When a receiver advertises a window size of 0, the sender stops sending
data and starts the persist timer. The persist timer is used to protect
TCP from a deadlock situation that could arise if a subsequent window
size update from the receiver is lost, and the sender cannot send more
data until receiving a new window size update from the receiver. When
the persist-timer expires, the TCP sender attempts recovery by sending a
small packet so that the receiver responds by sending another
acknowledgement containing the new window size.</p>
<p>If a receiver is processing incoming data in small increments, it may
repeatedly advertise a small receive window. This is referred to as the
silly window syndrome, since it is inefficient to send only a few bytes
of data in a TCP segment, given the relatively large overhead of the TCP
header.</p>
<p><strong>Congestion control</strong></p>
<p>The final main aspect of TCP is congestion control. TCP uses a number of
mechanisms to achieve high performance and avoid congestion collapse,
where network performance can fall by several orders of magnitude. These
mechanisms control the rate of data entering the network, keeping the
data flow below a rate that would trigger collapse. They also yield an
approximately max-min fair allocation between flows.</p>
<p>Senders infer network conditions between the TCP sender and receiver use
acknowledgments for data sent, or lack of acknowledgments. Coupled with
timers, TCP senders and receivers can alter the behavior of the flow of
data. This is more generally referred to as congestion control and/or
network congestion avoidance.</p>
<p>Modern implementations of TCP contain four intertwined algorithms:
Slow-start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery
(RFC 5681).</p>
<p>In addition, senders employ a retransmission timeout (RTO) that is based
on the estimated round-trip time (or RTT) between the sender and
receiver, as well as the variance in this round trip time. The behavior
of this timer is specified in RFC 6298. There are subtleties in the
estimation of RTT. For example, senders must be careful when calculating
RTT samples for retransmitted packets; typically they use Karnâs
Algorithm or TCP timestamps (see RFC 1323). These individual RTT samples
are then averaged over time to create a Smoothed Round Trip Time (SRTT)
using Jacobsonâs algorithm. This SRTT value is what is finally used as
the round-trip time estimate.</p>
<p>Enhancing TCP to reliably handle loss, minimize errors, manage
congestion and go fast in very high-speed environments are ongoing areas
of research and standards development. As a result, there are a number
of TCP congestion avoidance algorithm variations.</p>
<p><strong>Delayed Binding</strong></p>
<p>Delayed binding, also called TCP connection splicing, is the
postponement of the connection between the client and the server in
order to obtain sufficient information to make a routing decision. Some
application switches and routers delay binding the client session to the
server until the proper handshakes are complete so as to prevent Denial
of Service attacks.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Explain the purpose and functionality of HTTP</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>HTTP Protocol</strong></p>
<p>HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server
computing model. A web browser, for example, may be the client and an
application running on a computer hosting a web site may be the server.
The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server,
which provides resources such as HTML files and other content, or
performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response
message to the client. The response contains completion status
information about the request and may also contain requested content in
its message body.</p>
<p>A web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user
agent include the indexing software used by search providers (web
crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and other software that
accesses, consumes, or displays web content.</p>
<p>HTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or
enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites
often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of
upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously
accessed web resources and reuses them when possible to reduce network
traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate
communication for clients without a globally routable address, by
relaying messages with external servers.</p>
<p>HTTP is an application layer protocol designed within the framework of
the Internet Protocol Suite. Its definition presumes an underlying and
reliable transport layer protocol, and Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) is commonly used. However HTTP can use unreliable protocols such
as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for example in Simple Service
Discovery Protocol (SSDP).</p>
<p>HTTP resources are identified and located on the network by Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URIs)âor, more specifically, Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs)âusing the http or https URI schemes. URIs and hyperlinks
in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) documents form webs of inter-linked
hypertext documents.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Differentiate between HTTP versions</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#History">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>HTTP versions</strong></p>
<p>The first documented version of HTTP was HTTP V0.9 (1991). Dave Raggett
led the HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG) in 1995 and wanted to expand the
protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer
meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more
efficient by adding additional methods and header fields. RFC 1945
officially introduced and recognized HTTP V1.0 in 1996.</p>
<p>The HTTP WG planned to publish new standards in December 1995 and the
support for pre-standard HTTP/1.1 based on the then developing RFC 2068
(called HTTP-NG) was rapidly adopted by the major browser developers in
early 1996. By March 1996, pre-standard HTTP/1.1 was supported in Arena,
Netscape 2.0, Netscape Navigator Gold 2.01, Mosaic 2.7, Lynx 2.5, and in
Internet Explorer 2.0. End-user adoption of the new browsers was rapid.
In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of
browsers in use on the Internet were HTTP 1.1 compliant. That same web
hosting company reported that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers
accessing their servers were HTTP/1.1 compliant. The HTTP/1.1 standard
as defined in RFC 2068 was officially released in January 1997.
Improvements and updates to the HTTP/1.1 standard were released under
RFC 2616 in June 1999.</p>
<p>Some of the major changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1 were based
around request methods. HTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as
verbs) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified
resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or
data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the
server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an
executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification defined
the GET, POST and HEAD methods and the HTTP/1.1 specification added 5
new methods: OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE, TRACE and CONNECT.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Interpret HTTP status codes</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Structure of HTTP Transactions</strong></p>
<p>Like most network protocols, HTTP uses the client-server model: An HTTP
client opens a connection and sends a request message to an HTTP server;
the server then returns a response message, usually containing the
resource that was requested. After delivering the response, the server
closes the connection (making HTTP a stateless protocol, i.e. not
maintaining any connection information between transactions).</p>
<p>The formats of the request and response messages are similar, and
English-oriented. Both kinds of messages consist of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an initial line,</li>
<li>zero or more header lines,</li>
<li>a blank line (i.e. a CRLF by itself), and</li>
<li>an optional message body (e.g. a file, or query data, or query output).</li>
</ul>
<p>Put another way, the format of an HTTP message is:</p>
<p>&lt;initial line, different for request vs. response&gt;</p>
<p>Header1: value1</p>
<p>Header2: value2</p>
<p>Header3: value3</p>
<p>&lt;optional message body goes here, like file contents or query data; it
can be many lines long, or even binary data <a class="reference external" href="mailto:$&amp;*%&#37;&#52;&#48;!^$&#37;&#52;&#48;">$&amp;*%<span>&#64;</span>!^$<span>&#64;</span></a>&gt;</p>
<p>Initial lines and headers should end in CRLF, though you should
gracefully handle lines ending in just LF. (More exactly, CR and LF here
mean ASCII values 13 and 10, even though some platforms may use
different characters.)</p>
<p>Initial Request Line</p>
<p>The initial line is different for the request than for the response. A
request line has three parts, separated by spaces: a method name, the
local path of the requested resource, and the version of HTTP being
used. A typical request line is:</p>
<p>GET /path/to/file/index.html HTTP/1.0</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>GET is the most common HTTP method; it says âgive me this resourceâ. Other
methods include POST and HEAD- - more on those later. Method names are
always uppercase.</li>
<li>The path is the part of the URL after the host name, also called the
request URI (a URI is like a URL, but more general).</li>
<li>The HTTP version always takes the form âHTTP/x.xâ, uppercase.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Initial Response Line (Status Line)</strong></p>
<p>The initial response line, called the status line, also has three parts
separated by spaces: the HTTP version, a response status code that gives
the result of the request, and an English reason phrase describing the
status code. Typical status lines are:</p>
<p>HTTP/1.0 200 OK or HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The HTTP version is in the same format as in the request line, âHTTP/x.xâ.</li>
<li>The status code is meant to be computer-readable; the reason phrase is
meant to be human-readable, and may vary.</li>
<li>The status code is a three-digit integer, and the first digit identifies
the general category of response:</li>
<li>1xx indicates an informational message only</li>
<li>2xx indicates success of some kind</li>
<li>3xx redirects the client to another URL</li>
<li>4xx indicates an error on the clientâs part</li>
<li>5xx indicates an error on the serverâs part</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The most common status codes are:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="16%" />
<col width="84%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><strong>200 OK</strong></th>
<th class="head">The request succeeded, and the resulting resource (e.g. file or script output) is returned in the message body.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>301</strong></td>
<td>Moved Permanently</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>302</strong></td>
<td>Moved Temporarily</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>303 See Other (HTTP 1.1 only)</strong></td>
<td>The resource has moved to another URL (given by the Location: response header), and should be automatically retrieved by the client. This is often used by a CGI script to redirect the browser to an existing file.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>403 Forbidden</strong></td>
<td>The request was a valid request, but the server is refusing to respond to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>404 Not Found</strong></td>
<td>The requested resource doesnât exist.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong></td>
<td>An unexpected server error. The most common cause is a server-side script that has bad syntax, fails, or otherwise canât run correctly.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>503 Service Unavailable</strong></td>
<td>The server is currently unavailable (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Header Lines</p>
<p>Header lines provide information about the request or response, or about
the object sent in the message body. The header lines are in the usual
text header format, which is: one line per header, of the form
âHeader-Name: valueâ, ending with CRLF. Itâs the same format used for
email and news postings.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Determine an HTTP request method for a given use case</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#othermethods">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Other HTTP Methods, Like HEAD and POST</strong></p>
<p>Besides GET, the two most commonly used methods are HEAD and POST.</p>
<p><strong>The HEAD Method</strong></p>
<p>A HEAD request is just like a GET request, except it asks the server to
return the response headers only, and not the actual resource (i.e. no
message body). This is useful to check characteristics of a resource
without actually downloading it, thus saving bandwidth. Use HEAD when
you donât actually need a fileâs contents.</p>
<p>The response to a HEAD request must never contain a message body, just
the status line and headers.</p>
<p><strong>The POST Method</strong></p>
<p>A POST request is used to send data to the server to be processed in
some way, like by a CGI script. A POST request is different from a GET
request in the following ways:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Thereâs a block of data sent with the request, in the message body. There
are usually extra headers to describe this message body, like
Content-Type: and Content-Length:.</li>
<li>The request URI is not a resource to retrieve; itâs usually a program to
handle the data youâre sending.</li>
<li>The HTTP response is normally program output, not a static file.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The most common use of POST, by far, is to submit HTML form data to CGI
scripts. In this case, the Content-Type: header is usually
application/x-www-form-urlencoded, and the Content-Length: header gives
the length of the URL-encoded form data (hereâs a note on URL-encoding).
The CGI script receives the message body through STDIN, and decodes it.
Hereâs a typical form submission, using POST:</p>
<p>POST /path/script.cgi HTTP/1.0</p>
<p>From: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:frog&#37;&#52;&#48;jmarshall&#46;com">frog<span>&#64;</span>jmarshall<span>&#46;</span>com</a></p>
<p>User-Agent: HTTPTool/1.0</p>
<p>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded</p>
<p>Content-Length: 32</p>
<p>home=Cosby&amp;favorite+flavor=flies</p>
<p>You can use a POST request to send whatever data you want, not just form
submissions. Just make sure the sender and the receiving program agree
on the format.</p>
<p>The GET method can also be used to submit forms. The form data is
URL-encoded and appended to the request URI.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP Keep-alives</strong></p>
<p>HTTP keep-alive, also called HTTP persistent connection, or HTTP
connection reuse, is the idea of using a single TCP connection to send
and receive multiple HTTP requests/responses, as opposed to opening a
new connection for every single request/response pair.</p>
<p>The Keep-Alive header field and the additional information it provides
are optional and do not need to be present to indicate a persistent
connection has been established.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP Headers</strong></p>
<p>HTTP header fields are components of the header section of request and
response messages in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). They define
the operating parameters of an HTTP transaction.</p>
<p>The header fields are transmitted after the request or response line,
which is the first line of a message. Header fields are colon-separated
name-value pairs in clear-text string format, terminated by a carriage
return (CR) and line feed (LF) character sequence. The end of the header
section is indicated by an empty field, resulting in the transmission of
two consecutive CR-LF pairs. Historically, long lines could be folded
into multiple lines; continuation lines are indicated by the presence of
a space (SP) or horizontal tab (HT) as the first character on the next
line. This folding is now deprecated.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong></p>
<p>If youâve ever used the Internet, itâs a good bet that youâve used the
Domain Name System, or DNS, even without realizing it. DNS is a protocol
within the set of standards for how computers exchange data on the
Internet and on many private networks, known as the TCP/IP protocol
suite. Its basic job is to turn a user-friendly domain name like
âhowstuffworks.comâ into an Internet Protocol (IP) address like
70.42.251.42 that computers use to identify each other on the network.
Itâs like your computerâs GPS for the Internet.</p>
<p>Computers and other network devices on the Internet use an IP address to
route your request to the site youâre trying to reach. This is similar
to dialing a phone number to connect to the person youâre trying to
call. Thanks to DNS, though, you donât have to keep your own address
book of IP addresses. Instead, you just connect through a domain name
server, also called a DNS server or name server, which manages a massive
database that maps domain names to IP addresses.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/1p13.png" src="../../_images/1p13.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Whether youâre accessing a Web site or sending e-mail, your computer
uses a DNS server to lookup the domain name youâre trying to
access. The proper term for this process is DNS name resolution, and you
would say that the DNS server resolves the domain name to the IP
address. For example, when you enter â<a class="reference external" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com">http://www.howstuffworks.com</a>â in
your browser, part of the network connection includes resolving the
domain name âhowstuffworks.comâ into an IP address, like 70.42.251.42,
for âHowStuffWorksâ Web servers.</p>
<p>You can always bypass a DNS lookup by entering 70.42.251.42 directly in
your browser (give it a try). However, youâre probably more likely to
remember âhowstuffworks.comâ when you want to return later. In addition,
a Web siteâs IP address can change over time, and some sites associate
multiple IP addresses with a single domain name.</p>
<p>Without DNS servers, the Internet would shut down very quickly. But how
does your computer know what DNS server to use? Typically, when you
connect to your home network, Internet service provider (ISP) or WiFi
network, the modem or router that assigns your computerâs network
address also sends some important network configuration information to
your computer or mobile device.</p>
<p>That configuration includes one or more DNS servers that the device
should use when translating DNS names to IP address.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/unified-communications/business-edition-3000/what_sip.pdf">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)</strong></p>
<p>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a communications protocol used for
communicating between different devices on a company network, whether on
the LAN, the WAN, or across the Internet. An example of this could be a
simple two-way phone conversation, using voice over IP (VoIP) on the LAN
or WAN or a SIP trunk across the Internet to a service provider. A SIP
trunk provides a new way of connecting to a service provider for
incoming and outgoing calls; it is a connection over the Internet
instead of a traditional telephone connection such as ISDN.</p>
<p>SIP allows you to take full advantage of applications such as video
conferencing, presence, and instant messaging. These applications, and
others like them, when working together are known as unified
communications. Unified communications opens up a new world of
possibilities in how you interact with your customers and prospects,
giving them a richer experience when dealing with you and your staff.</p>
<p>SIP provides businesses many benefits over older, proprietary telephony
solutions, and best of all, it can save you money.</p>
<p>In the past, connections to the service provider (telephone company)
were possible only using a dedicated telephone line, such as an ISDN
connection.</p>

<p><strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</strong></p>
<p>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to
transfer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network,
such as the Internet. FTP is built on client-server architecture and
uses separate control and data connections between the client and the
server. FTP users may authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in
protocol, normally in the form of a username and password, but can
connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it. For secure
transmission that hides (encrypts) the username and password, and
encrypts the content, FTP is often secured with SSL/TLS (âFTPSâ). SSH
File Transfer Protocol (âSFTPâ) is sometimes also used instead, but is
technologically different.</p>
<p>The first FTP client applications were command-line applications
developed before operating systems had graphical user interfaces, and
are still shipped with most Windows, Unix, and Linux operating systems.
Dozens of FTP clients and automation utilities have since been developed
for desktops, servers, mobile devices, and hardware, and FTP has been
incorporated into hundreds of productivity applications, such as Web
page editors.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Differentiate between passive and active FTP</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>Active FTP vs. Passive FTP</strong></p>
<p>One of the most commonly seen questions when dealing with firewalls and
other Internet connectivity issues is the difference between active and
passive FTP and how best to support either or both of them. Hopefully
the following text will help to clear up some of the confusion over how
to support FTP in a firewalled environment.</p>
<p><strong>The Basics</strong></p>
<p>FTP is a TCP based service exclusively. There is no UDP component to
FTP. FTP is an unusual service in that it utilizes two ports, a âdataâ
port and a âcommandâ port (also known as the control port).
Traditionally these are port 21 for the command port and port 20 for the
data port. The confusion begins however, when we find that depending on
the mode, the data port is not always on port 20.</p>
<p><strong>Active FTP</strong></p>
<p>In active mode FTP the client connects from a random unprivileged port
(N &gt; 1023) to the FTP serverâs command port, port 21. Then, the client
starts listening to port N+1 and sends the FTP command PORT N+1 to the
FTP server. The server will then connect back to the clientâs specified
data port from its local data port, which is port 20.</p>
<p>From the server-side firewallâs standpoint, to support active mode FTP
the following communication channels need to be opened:</p>
<p>FTP serverâs port 21 from anywhere (Client initiates connection)</p>
<p>FTP serverâs port 21 to ports &gt; 1023 (Server responds to clientâs
control port)</p>
<p>FTP serverâs port 20 to ports &gt; 1023 (Server initiates data connection
to clientâs data port)</p>
<p>FTP serverâs port 20 from ports &gt; 1023 (Client sends ACKs to serverâs
data port)</p>
<p>When drawn out, the connection appears as follows:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/1p16.png" src="../../_images/1p16.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The clientâs command port contacts the serverâs command port and
sends the command PORT 1027.</li>
<li>The server then sends an ACK back to the clientâs command port</li>
<li>The server initiates a connection on its local data port to the data port the
client specified earlier.</li>
<li>Finally, the client sends an ACK.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main problem with active mode FTP actually falls on the client side.
The FTP client doesnât make the actual connection to the data port of
the serverâit simply tells the server what port it is listening on and
the server connects back to the specified port on the client. From the
client-side firewall this appears to be an outside system initiating a
connection to an internal clientâsomething that is usually blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Passive FTP</strong></p>
<p>In order to resolve the issue of the server initiating the connection to
the client a different method for FTP connections was developed. This
was known as passive mode, or PASV, after the command used by the client
to tell the server it is in passive mode.</p>
<p>In passive mode FTP the client initiates both connections to the server,
solving the problem of firewalls filtering the incoming data port
connection to the client from the server. When opening an FTP
connection, the client opens two random unprivileged ports locally (N &gt;
1023 and N+1). The first port contacts the server on port 21, but
instead of then issuing a PORT command and allowing the server to
connect back to its data port, the client will issue the PASV command.
The result of this is that the server then opens a random unprivileged
port (P &gt; 1023) and sends P back to the client in response to the PASV
command. The client then initiates the connection from port N+1 to port
P on the server to transfer data.</p>
<p>From the server-side firewallâs standpoint, to support passive mode FTP
the following communication channels need to be opened:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>FTP serverâs port 21 from anywhere (Client initiates connection)</li>
<li>FTP serverâs port 21 to ports &gt; 1023 (Server responds to clientâs control
port)</li>
<li>FTP serverâs ports &gt; 1023 from anywhere (Client initiates data connection to
random port specified by server</li>
<li>FTP serverâs ports &gt; 1023 to remote ports &gt; 1023 (Server sends ACKs (and
data) to clientâs data port)</li>
</ul>
<p>When drawn, a passive mode FTP connection looks like this:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/1p17.png" src="../../_images/1p17.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li>The client contacts the server on the command port and issues the PASV
command.</li>
<li>The server then replies with PORT 2024, telling the client which port it is
listening to for the data connection.</li>
<li>The client then initiates the data connection from its data port to the
specified server data port.</li>
<li>Finally, the server sends back an ACK to the clientâs data port.</li>
</ul>
<p>While passive mode FTP solves many of the problems from the client side,
it opens up a whole range of problems on the server side. The biggest
issue is the need to allow any remote connection to high numbered ports
on the server. Fortunately, many FTP daemons, including the popular
WU-FTPD allow the administrator to specify a range of ports, which the
FTP server will use.</p>
<p>The second issue involves supporting and troubleshooting clients, which
do (or do not) support passive mode. As an example, the command line FTP
utility provided with Solaris does not support passive mode,
necessitating a third-party FTP client, such as ncftp.</p>

<p><strong>The SMTP Server</strong></p>
<p>Whenever you send a piece of e-mail, your e-mail client interacts with
the SMTP server to handle the sending. The SMTP server on your host may
have conversations with other SMTP servers to deliver the e-mail. Letâs
assume that I want to send a piece of e-mail. My e-mail ID is brain, and
I have my account on howstuffworks.com. I want to send e-mail to
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:jsmith&#37;&#52;&#48;mindspring&#46;com">jsmith<span>&#64;</span>mindspring<span>&#46;</span>com</a>. I am using a stand-alone e-mail client like
Outlook Express.</p>
<p>When I set up my account at HowStuffWorks, I told Outlook Express the
name of the mail server â mail.howstuffworks.com. When I compose a
message and press the Send button, here is what happens:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Outlook Express connects to the SMTP server at mail.howstuffworks.com using
port 25.</li>
<li>Outlook Express has a conversation with the SMTP server, telling the SMTP
server the address of the sender and the address of the recipient, as well as
the body of the message.</li>
<li>The SMTP server takes the âtoâ address (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:jsmith&#37;&#52;&#48;mindspring&#46;com">jsmith<span>&#64;</span>mindspring<span>&#46;</span>com</a>) and breaks it
into two parts: the recipient name (jsmith) and the domain name
(mindspring.com). If the âtoâ address had been another user at
howstuffworks.com, the SMTP server would simply hand the message to the POP3
server for howstuffworks.com (using a little program called the delivery
agent). Since the recipient is at another domain, SMTP needs to communicate
with that domain.</li>
<li>The SMTP server has a conversation with a Domain Name Server, or DNS. It
says, âCan you give me the IP address of the SMTP server for mindspring.com?â
The DNS replies with the one or more IP addresses for the SMTP server(s)
that Mindspring operates.</li>
<li>The SMTP server at howstuffworks.com connects with the SMTP server at
Mindspring using port 25. It has the same simple text conversation that my
e-mail client had with the SMTP server for HowStuffWorks, and gives the
message to the Mindspring server. The Mindspring server recognizes that the
domain name for jsmith is at Mindspring, so it hands the message to
Mindspringâs POP3 server, which puts the message in jsmithâs mailbox.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, for some reason, the SMTP server at HowStuffWorks cannot connect
with the SMTP server at Mindspring, then the message goes into a queue.
The SMTP server on most machines uses a program called sendmail to do
the actual sending, so this queue is called the sendmail queue. Sendmail
will periodically try to resend the messages in its queue. For example,
it might retry every 15 minutes. After four hours, it will usually send
you a piece of mail that tells you there is some sort of problem. After
five days, most sendmail configurations give up and return the mail to
you undelivered.</p>
<p>The SMTP server understands very simple text commands like HELO, MAIL,
RCPT and DATA. The most common commands are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>HELO - introduce yourself</li>
<li>EHLO - introduce yourself and request extended mode</li>
<li>MAIL FROM: - specify the sender</li>
<li>RCPT TO: - specify the recipient</li>
<li>DATA - specify the body of the message (To, From and Subject should be the
first three lines.)</li>
<li>RSET - reset</li>
<li>QUIT - quit the session</li>
<li>HELP - get help on commands</li>
<li>VRFY - verify an address</li>
<li>EXPN - expand an address</li>
<li>VERB - verbose</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.05 - Explain the purpose and functionality of a cookie</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/cookie.htm/printable">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>How HTTP Cookies Work</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a piece of text that a Web server can store on a userâs hard
disk. Cookies allow a Web site to store information on a userâs machine
and later retrieve it. The pieces of information are stored as
name-value pairs.</p>
<p>For example, a Web site might generate a unique ID number for each
visitor and store the ID number on each userâs machine using a cookie
file.</p>
<p>If you use Microsoftâs Internet Explorer to browse the Web, you can see
all of the cookies that are stored on your machine. The most common
place for them to reside is in a directory called c:/windowscookies.
When I look in that directory on my machine, I find 165 files. Each file
is a text file that contains name-value pairs, and there is one file for
each Web site that has placed cookies on my machine.</p>
<p>You can see in the directory that each of these files is a simple,
normal text file. You can see which Web site placed the file on your
machine by looking at the file name (the information is also stored
inside the file). You can open each file by clicking on it.</p>
<p>For example, I have visited goto.com, and the site has placed a cookie
on my machine. The cookie file for goto.com contains the following
information:</p>
<p>UserID A9A3BECE0563982D www.goto.com/</p>
<p>Goto.com has stored on my machine a single name-value pair. The name of
the pair is UserID, and the value is A9A3BECE0563982D. The first time I
visited goto.com, the site assigned me a unique ID value and stored it
on my machine.</p>
<p>(Note that there probably are several other values stored in the file
after the three shown above. That is housekeeping information for the
browser.)</p>
<p>The vast majority of sites store just one piece of information â a user
ID â on your machine. But a site can store many name-value pairs if it
wants to.</p>
<p>A name-value pair is simply a named piece of data. It is not a program,
and it cannot âdoâ anything. A Web site can retrieve only the
information that it has placed on your machine. It cannot retrieve
information from other cookie files, or any other information from your
machine.</p>
<p><strong>How do Web sites use cookies?</strong></p>
<p>Cookies evolved because they solve a big problem for the people who
implement Web sites. In the broadest sense, a cookie allows a site to
store state information on your machine. This information lets a Web
site remember what state your browser is in. An ID is one simple piece
of state information â if an ID exists on your machine, the site knows
that you have visited before. The state is, âYour browser has visited
the site at least one time,â and the site knows your ID from that visit.</p>
<p>Web sites use cookies in many different ways. Here are some of the most
common examples:</p>
<p>Sites can accurately determine how many people actually visit the site.
It turns out that because of proxy servers, caching, concentrators and
so on, the only way for a site to accurately count visitors is to set a
cookie with a unique ID for each visitor. Using cookies, sites can
determine how many visitors arrive, how many are new versus repeat
visitors and how often a visitor has visited. Sites can store user
preferences so that the site can look different for each visitor (often
referred to as customization). For example, if you visit msn.com, it
offers you the ability to âchange content/layout/color.â It also allows
you to enter your zip code and get customized weather information. When
you enter your zip code, the following name-value pair gets added to
MSNâs cookie file:</p>
<p>WEAT CC=NC%5FRaleigh%2DDurhamÂ®ION= www.msn.com/</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Since I live in Raleigh, N.C., this makes sense.</li>
<li>Most sites seem to store preferences like this in the siteâs database and
store nothing but an ID as a cookie, but storing the actual values in
name-value pairs is another way to do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>E-commerce sites can implement things like shopping carts and âquick
checkoutâ options. The cookie contains an ID and lets the site keep
track of you as you add different things to your cart. Each item you add
to your shopping cart is stored in the siteâs database along with your
ID value.</p>
<p>When you check out, the site knows what is in your cart by retrieving
all of your selections from the database. It would be impossible to
implement a convenient shopping mechanism without cookies or something
like them.</p>
<p>In all of these examples, note that what the database is able to store
are items you have selected from the site, pages you have viewed from
the site, information you have given to the site in online forms, etc.
All of the information is stored in the siteâs database, and in most
cases, a cookie containing your unique ID is all that is stored on your
computer.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Given a situation in which a client connects to a remote host,
explain how the name resolution process occurs</strong></p>
<p><strong>REF 1 p 970 - 982</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name Resolution Process</strong></p>
<p>If a user wants to connect to an application or website on a network,
either public or private, they must know where to go to get to the
application. As we have been discussing in the prior sections, all of
the locations on a network have an IP address that can be connected to
for the residing application or service. The challenge is remembering
all of the IP addresses of the sites or applications that we need to
connect to on a day-to-day basis. It is easier for a human to remember a
name than an IP address. For instance it is easier to remember
www.google.com than 74.125.229.178. However to use a name instead of an
IP address means a record of what names correlate to which IP address
has to be maintained and be made available to search by all network
attached nodes. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical
distributed naming system used for this function.</p>
<p>In the DNS name resolution process, for a client to connect to a remote
host, quite a few steps take place. Lets go through those steps at a
high level.</p>
<p>A user wants to get to the website www.google.com. So he/she opens a
browser and types www.google.com in the path bar in the browser. The
users system doesnât inherently know the IP address of the website. So
it does a DNS lookup of the name and the process is basically like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The user system will look in its local host file for a matching entry for
www.google.com. If an entry matches it will use that IP address, and the
process ends here.</li>
<li>If an entry is not found in the local host file, the user system will look to
its local name cache for a matching entry for www.google.com. If an entry
exists then it will attempt to connect to that address, and the process ends
here.</li>
<li>If there is no record in the user systemâs cache then the system will request
the IP address from its local DNS server for www.google.com.</li>
<li>If the local DNS server has an entry for www.google.com in its cache then it
will respond to the user system with that IP address. The system will put the
entry in its cache and connect to the address. The process is then complete.</li>
<li>If the local DNS server does not have an entry for www.google.com in its
cache then the local DNS server will make a call to the root servers in its
DNS configuration for the IP address of the Authoritative Name Server for the
.com domain. The Local DNS server will then query the Authoritative Name
Server of the .com domain for the Authoritative Name Server of the
.google.com domain. Once the local DNS server has that IP address, it will
query the Authoritative Name Server of the .google.com domain for the A
record (IP address) of www.google.com.</li>
<li>The local DNS server will place that response into its cache and then it will
respond to the user system with that IP address. The user system will put the
entry in its cache and connect to the address. The process is then complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these steps will take place extremely fast and only add
milliseconds to the process of the connection to the website but for
every name that the user system is told to connect to, this process
takes place.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Explain the purpose and functionality of a URL</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.f5.com">Link to Online Topic Content</a></p>
<p><strong>URL - Uniform Resource Locator</strong></p>
<p>A uniform resource locator (URL) is a reference to a resource that
specifies the location of the resource on a computer network and a
mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of uniform
resource identifier (URI), although many people use the two terms
interchangeably. A URL implies the means to access an indicated
resource, which is not true of every URI. URLs occur most commonly to
reference web pages (HTTP), but are also used for file transfer (FTP),
email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.</p>
<p>Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an
address bar.</p>
<p>Every HTTP URL consists of the following, in the given order. Several
schemes other than HTTP also share this general format, with some
variation.</p>
<p>The syntax is:</p>
<p>scheme://[user:password&#64;]domain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id</p>
<p>Component details:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The scheme, which in many cases is the name of a protocol (but not always),
defines how the resource will be obtained. Examples include HTTP, HTTPS, FTP,
file and many others. Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical
form is lowercase.</li>
<li>The domain name or literal numeric IP address gives the destination location
for the URL. A literal numeric IPv6 address may be given, but must be
enclosed in [ ]. e.g. [db8:0cec::99:123a]. The domain google.com, or its
numeric IP address 173.194.34.5, is the address of Googleâs website.</li>
<li>The domain name portion of a URL is not case sensitive since DNS ignores
case: <a class="reference external" href="http://en.example.org/">http://en.example.org/</a> and <a class="reference external" href="HTTP://EN.EXAMPLE.ORG/">HTTP://EN.EXAMPLE.ORG/</a> both open the same
page.</li>
<li>The port number, given in decimal, is optional; if omitted, the default for
the scheme is used. For example, <a class="reference external" href="http://vnc.example.com:5800">http://vnc.example.com:5800</a> connects to port
5800 of vnc.example.com, which may be appropriate for a VNC remote control
session. If the port number is omitted for an http: URL, the browser will
connect on port 80, the default HTTP port. The default port for an https:
request is 443.</li>
<li>The path is used to specify and perhaps find the resource requested. This
path may or may not describe folders on the file system in the web server. It
may be very different from the arrangement of folders on the web server. It
is case-sensitive, [14] though it may be treated as case-insensitive by some
servers, especially those based on Microsoft Windows. If the server is case
sensitive and <a class="reference external" href="http://en.example.org/wiki/URL">http://en.example.org/wiki/URL</a> is correct, then
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.example.org/WIKI/URL">http://en.example.org/WIKI/URL</a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.example.org/wiki/url">http://en.example.org/wiki/url</a> will display
an HTTP 404 error page, unless these URLs point to valid resources
themselves.</li>
<li>The query string contains data to be passed to software running on the
server. It may contain name/value pairs separated by ampersands, for example:
?first_name=John&amp;last_name=Doe.</li>
<li>The fragment identifier, if present, specifies a part or a position within
the overall resource or document. When used with HTML, it usually specifies a
section or location within the page, and used in combination with Anchor
elements or the âidâ attribute of an element, the browser is scrolled to
display that part of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scheme name defines the namespace, purpose, and the syntax of the
remaining part of the URL. Software will try to process a URL according
to its scheme and context. For example, a web browser will usually
dereference the URL <a class="reference external" href="http://example.org:80">http://example.org:80</a> by performing an HTTP request
to the host at example.org, using port number 80.</p>
<p>Other schemes do not follow the HTTP pattern. For example, the mailto
scheme only uses valid email addresses. When clicked on in an
application, the URL <a class="reference external" href="mailto:bob&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;com">mailto:bob<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a> may start an e-mail composer
with the address <a class="reference external" href="mailto:bob&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;com">bob<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a> in the To field. The tel scheme is even
more different; it uses the public switched telephone network for
addressing, instead of domain names representing Internet hosts.</p>
