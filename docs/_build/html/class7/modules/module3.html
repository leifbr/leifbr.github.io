<p><strong>3.01 - Interpret log file messages to identify LTM device issues</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14426">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14426</a></p>
<p><strong>Identifying hardware issues</strong></p>
<p>This can be a very broad topic because there are a very large number of
hardware errors that can occur. Every log message will contain an ID
number and will be followed by a description in the log.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Back in version 11.4 the pendsect feature was added to the TMOS software
that periodically checks for pending sector alerts and resolves them.
The pendsect feature is configured to run daily. The pendsect messages
provide improved disk error detection and correction. The system logs
the pendsect messages to the /var/log/user.log file.</p>
<p>When the pendsect process runs and no errors are detected or corrected,
the system logs messages that appear similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">warning pendsect[21788]: pendsect: /dev/sdb no Pending Sectors detected</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the pendsect process detects and corrects an error, the system logs
messages that appear similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">warning pendsect[19772]: Recovered LBA:230000007</span>
<span class="go">warning pendsect[19772]: Drive /dev/sda partition UNKNOWN</span>
<span class="go">warning pendsect[19772]: File affected NONE</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the pendsect process detects an error and is unable to correct the
error, the system logs messages that appear similar to the following
example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">warning pendsect[20702]: seek(1) error[25] recovery of LBA:226300793 not complete</span>
<span class="go">warning pendsect[20702]: Drive: /dev/sda filesystem type: Undetermined</span>
<span class="go">warning pendsect[20702]: File affected: NONE</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Recommended Actions</p>
<p>If pendsect reports an uncorrectable error, or if you suspect a possible
disk failure, you can perform the End-User Diagnostic (EUD) SMART test
to test the drive. For information about the EUD utility, and links to
the latest release notes, refer to K7172: Overview of the End User
Diagnostics software.</p>
<p>Beginning in BIG-IP 11.4.0, you can also use the platform_check command
to collect the SMART test data from the drive. The disk portion of the
command output indicates a Pass or Fail status for the drive and logs
detailed information to the /var/log/platform_check file.</p>

<p><strong>Troubleshooting using iHealth</strong></p>
<p>The F5 iHealth server is a tool that helps you troubleshoot potential
issues. It does this by analyzing configuration, logs, command output,
password security, license compliance, and so on.</p>
<p>From F5 BIG-IQ Centralized Management, you can create a snapshot of a
configuration in the form of a QKView file and then upload it to the F5
iHealth server. The file is compared to the iHealth database, which
contains known issues, common configuration errors, and F5 published
best practices. F5 returns an iHealth report you can use to identify any
potential issues that you need to attend to.</p>
<p><em>Troubleshoot potential issues by viewing an iHealth device report</em></p>
<p>After you upload a QKView file for one or more BIG-IP devices, the F5
iHealth server returns a device report.</p>
<p>Review the device report so you can address any potential issues or
vulnerabilities. From the report, you can access and sort heuristics
associated with a device.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>At the top of the screen, click Monitoring.</li>
<li>On the left, click REPORTS &gt; Device &gt; iHealth &gt; Device Reports .</li>
<li>Click the Open link next to the report you want to view.</li>
<li>To sort the heuristics for a report you’ve opened, select an option
from the All Importance and/or the All Flags list.</li>
<li>You can add a flag to a specific heuristic by selecting the check box
next to it, and selecting a flag from the All Flags list.</li>
<li>To view more details about a specific heuristic, click on its link.</li>
<li>To view an article on the AskF5 Knowledge Center database to get more
information about this heuristic, click the solution link.</li>

<p><strong>3.01 - Identify appropriate methods to troubleshoot NTP</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14120">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K14120</a></p>
<p><strong>NTP</strong></p>
<p>NTP is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over
the network. On BIG-IP systems, accurate timestamps are essential to
guarantee the correct behavior of a number of features. While in most
cases it is sufficient to configure a couple of time servers that the
BIG-IP system will use to update its system time, it is also possible to
define more advanced NTP configurations on the BIG-IP system.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K10240">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K10240</a></p>
<p>When the BIG-IP system clock is not showing the correct time zone, or
the date and time is not synchronized correctly, this could be caused by
incorrect NTP configuration or a communication issue with a valid NTP
peer server. The procedures in this article show how you may check the
NTP daemon process, verify the NTP configuration, query the NTP peer
server, and check the network connectivity to the NTP peer server.</p>
<p>When verifying the NTP peer server communication, you can use the ntpq
utility. The command generates output with the fields that are explained
in the following table.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="5%" />
<col width="95%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><strong>Field</strong></th>
<th class="head"><strong>Definition</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>prefix to the&nbsp;<strong>remote</strong>
field</td>
<td><ul class="first last simple">
<li>An asterisk (*) character indicates that the peer has been declared the system peer and lends its variables to the system variables.</li>
<li>A plus sign (+) indicates that the peer is a survivor and a candidate for the combining algorithm.</li>
<li>A space, x, period (.), dash (-), or hash (#) character indicates that this peer is not being used for synchronization because it either does not meet the requirements, is unreachable, or is not needed.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>remote</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>remote</strong>&nbsp;field is the address of the remote peer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>refid</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>refid</strong>&nbsp;field is the Reference ID which identifies the server or reference clock with which the remote peer synchronizes, and its interpretation depends on the value of the stratum field (explained in the <strong>st</strong>&nbsp;definition). For stratum 0 (unspecified or invalid), the refid is an ascii value used for debugging. Example: INIT or STEP. For stratum 1 (reference clock), the refid is an ascii value used to specify the type of external clock source. Example: NIST refers to NIST telephone modem. For strata 2 through 15, the refid is the address of the next lower stratum server used for synchronization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>st</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>st</strong>&nbsp;field is the stratum of the remote peer. Primary servers (servers with an external reference clock such as GPS) are assigned stratum 1. A secondary NTP server which synchronizes with a stratum 1 server is assigned stratum 2. A secondary NTP server which synchronizes with a stratum 2 server is assigned stratum 3. Stratum 16 is referred to as “MAXSTRAT,” is customarily mapped to stratum value 0, and therefore indicates being unsynchronized. Strata 17 through 255 are reserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>t</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>t</strong> field is the type of peer: local, unicast, multicast, or broadcast.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>when</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>when</strong>&nbsp;field is the time since the last response to a poll was received (in seconds).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>poll</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>poll</strong> field is the polling interval (in seconds). This value starts low (example: 64) and over time, as no changes are detected, this polling value increases incrementally to the configured max polling value (example: 1024).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>reach</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>reach</strong>&nbsp;field is the reachability register. The octal shift register records results of the last eight poll attempts.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>delay</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>delay</strong>&nbsp;field is the current estimated delay; the transit time between these peers in milliseconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>offset</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>offset</strong> field is the current estimated offset; the time difference between these peers in milliseconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>jitter</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>jitter</strong>&nbsp;field is the current estimated dispersion; the variation in delay between these peers in milliseconds.</td>
</tr>

<p><strong>3.01 - Identify license problems based on the log file messages and statistics</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/releasenotes/related/log-messages.html#A01010044">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/releasenotes/related/log-messages.html#A01010044</a></p>
<p><strong>Licensing based log messages</strong></p>
<p>There are multiple types of log messages that could occur around
licensing.</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">01010044 : &quot;%s feature %s licensed&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Location:</em></p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">/var/log/ltm</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Conditions:</em></p>
<p>This message does not necessarily denote a problem. It displays the
license status of BIG-IP device’s component.</p>
<p>When status for component X is “licensed”, this log displays the message:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">Component X is licensed.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the component is not licensed, the message is:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">Component X is NOT licensed.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Impact:</em></p>
<p>If the message is “Component X is licensed”, there is no impact. It
is an informative message.</p>
<p>If the message is “Component X is not licensed”, then you cannot use
the mentioned component/feature.</p>
<p><em>Recommended Action:</em></p>
<p>If you want to use a component that is not currently licensed, you
need to activate the license.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When the system statistics show bandwidth of the licensed feature is
running at the max level you may see logs reflecting that the system is
exceeding the licensed limit.</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">01010045 : Bandwidth utilization is %d Mbps, exceeded %d%% of Licensed %d Mbps</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Location:</em></p>
<p>/var/log/ltm</p>
<p><em>Conditions:</em></p>
<p>This message appears when the system is using more bandwidth that it was licensed to use.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em></p>
<p>The system will not perform at its full potential with a limited license.</p>
<p><em>Recommended Action:</em></p>
<p>A license with better bandwidth utilization would stop this message from appearing.</p>

<p><strong>Identify Hardware Problems</strong></p>
<p>This can be a very broad topic because there are a very large number of
hardware errors that can occur. Every log message will begin with an ID
number and will be followed by a description in the log. The list of
possible log messages is long and memorizing them is not required, but
understanding how to read the messages and where logs can be found are
important. You will find many hardware related log messages in
/var/log/ltm and when you see LCD in the location that means it will
echo to the LCD screen of the device.</p>
<p><strong>Log Message Example</strong></p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">012a0028 : %s</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Location:</em></p>
<p>/var/log/ltm, LCD</p>
<p><em>Conditions:</em></p>
<p>AOM has indicated that a temperature sensor has crossed a ‘warning’ threshold.</p>
<p><em>Impact:</em></p>
<p>Integrity of the hardware could be at risk if overheating is not mitigated.</p>
<p><em>Recommended Action:</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Check the fan status of the unit using ‘tmsh show sys hardware’.</li>
<li>Inspect the LCD and/or /var/log/ltm for any fan related problems.</li>
<li>Ensure that ambient room temperature in which the device is located
has sufficient cooling.</li>
<li>Inspect /var/log/ltm and /var/log/sel around the time of the message
for any additional indications as to why the unit might be starting
to overheat.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also correlate information in the performance statistics to
hardware errors in the logs.</p>

<p><strong>Identify resource exhaustion problems</strong></p>
<p>There can be many types of resource exhaustion issues to troubleshoot.
This example is based on memory exhaustion due to a SYN flood. Your exam
may contain other types.</p>
<p>Detecting DoS and DDoS attacks</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system provides methods to detect ongoing or previous DoS and
DDoS attacks on the system. To detect these attacks, perform the
following procedures:</p>
<p>The BIG-IP SYN cookie feature protects the system against SYN flood
attacks and allows the BIG-IP system to maintain connections when the
SYN queue begins to fill up during an attack.</p>
<p>Reviewing SYN cookie threshold log messages</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system may log one or more error messages that relate to SYN
cookie protection to the /var/log/ltm file. Messages that relate to SYN
cookie protection appear similar to the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">When the virtual server exceeds the SYN Check Activation Threshold,
the system logs an error message similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">warning tmm5[18388]: 01010038:4: Syncookie threshold 0 exceeded,</span>
<span class="go">virtual = 10.11.16.238:80</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When hardware SYN cookie mode is active for a virtual server, the
system logs an error message similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">notice tmm5[18388]: 01010240:5: Syncookie HW mode activated, server</span>
<span class="go">= 10.11.16.238:80, HSB modId = 1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When hardware SYN cookie mode is not active for a virtual server, the
system logs an error message similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">notice tmm5[18388]: 01010241:5: Syncookie HW mode exited, server =</span>
<span class="go">10.11.16.238:80, HSB modId = 1 from HSB</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reviewing maximum reject rate log messages</p>
<p>The tm.maxrejectrate db key allows you to adjust the number of TCP RSTs
or ICMP unreachable packets that the BIG-IP system sends in response to
incoming client-side or server-side packets that cannot be matched with
existing connections to BIG-IP virtual servers, self IP addresses, or
Secure Network Address Translations (SNATs). A high number of maximum
reject rate messages may indicate that the BIG-IP system is experiencing
a DoS/DDoS attack.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system may log error messages that relate to SYN cookie
protection to the /var/log/ltm file. Messages that relate to SYN cookie
protection appear similar to the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">When the number of packets that match a virtual IP address or a self
IP address exceeds the tm.maxrejectrate threshold, but the packets
specify an invalid port, the system stops sending RST packets in
response to the unmatched packets and logs an error message to the
/var/log/ltm file that appears similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">011e0001:4: Limiting closed port RST response from 299 to 250</span>
<span class="go">packets/sec</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">When the number of packets that match a virtual address and port, or
a self IP address and port, exceeds the tm.maxrejectrate threshold,
but the packet is not a TCP SYN packet and does not match an
established connection, the system stops sending RST packets in
response to the unmatched packets. The system also logs an error
message to the /var/log/ltm file that appears similar to the
following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">011e0001:4: Limiting open port RST response from 251 to 250</span>
<span class="go">packets/sec</span>

<p><strong>Virtual Server Processing Order</strong></p>
<p>There can be many types of connectivity issues to troubleshoot. This
Error Message example is based on connectivity failure between an HA
pair. Your exam may contain other types.</p>
<p>Error Message</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">01071431:5: Attempting to connect to CMI peer &lt;IP address&gt; port &lt;port&gt;</span>

<p>In this error message, note the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&lt;IP address&gt; is the remote BIG-IP system’s configured failover IP
address, used for failover operations.</li>
<li>&lt;port&gt; is the remote BIG-IP system’s configured failover TCP service
port, used for failover operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">01071431:5: Attempting to connect to CMI peer 192.168.10.100 port 6699</span>

<p>Message Location</p>
<p>You may encounter this message in the following location:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>/var/log/ltm</li>
</ul>
<p>Description</p>
<p>This message occurs when all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You have multiple BIG-IP systems in a high availability (HA)
configuration.</li>
<li>The master control process daemon (mcpd) starts and attempts to
connect to a peer BIG-IP system in the trust domain or general
network issues exist, such as routing or switching failures, which
prevent connectivity between BIG-IP systems in the trust domain.</li>
</ul>
<p>A trust domain is a collection of BIG-IP devices that trust each other.
The devices can synchronize, fail over their BIG-IP configuration data,
and exchange status and failover messages on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Impact</p>
<p>If this error message appears unaccompanied by other messages, then
there is no impact on the BIG-IP system. If other messages are logged
along with this error message, you can use those messages to
troubleshoot the impact on the BIG-IP system. For example, if a general
network issue occurs and the local BIG-IP system is unable to connect to
a remote peer BIG-IP system, a message appearing similar to the
following example is logged:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">01071431:5: Attempting to connect to CMI peer 192.168.10.100 port 6699</span>

<span class="go">0107142f:3: Can&#39;t connect to CMI peer 192.168.10.100, port:6699, Transport endpoint is not connected</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Recommended Actions</p>
<p>If logged messages indicate that the BIG-IP system is impacted, ensure
that the self IP addresses for the BIG-IP devices in the cluster are
correct and that the network allows proper connectivity between the
devices.</p>

<p><strong>Logging</strong></p>
<p>BIG-IP log files include important diagnostic information about the
events that are occurring on the BIG-IP system. Some of the events
pertain to the Linux host. For example, the Linux host generates system
messages that pertain to the Linux host operating system, including
messages that are logged during system startup, and information logged
by the background daemons that run on the system. Other events are
specific to the BIG-IP operating system. For example, the BIG-IP
operating system generates messages that pertain to local and global
traffic events, and configuration changes (audit logging).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Local logging</p>
<p>By default, the BIG-IP system logs events locally and stores messages in
the /var/log directory. For BIG-IP events, the system routes messages
from the errdefs subsystem through syslog-ng to the local log files. For
non-BIG-IP events, the system routes messages directly through syslog-ng
to the local log files. In addition, you can configure the system to use
the high-speed logging mechanism (HSL) to store the logs in either the
syslog or the MySQL database.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Remote logging</p>
<p>You can configure the system to use the HSL mechanism to log messages to
a pool of remote log servers. If the BIG-IP system processes a high
volume of traffic or generates an excessive amount of log files, F5
recommends that you configure remote logging.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><strong>BIG-IP log types</strong></p>
<p>Each type of event is stored locally in a separate log file, and the
information stored in each log file varies depending on the event type.
All log files for these event types are in the /var/log directory.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding BIG-IP CPU usage</strong></p>
<p>The Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) processes all load-balanced
traffic on the BIG-IP system. TMM runs as a real-time user process
within the BIG-IP operating system (TMOS). CPU and memory resources are
explicitly provisioned in the BIG-IP configuration.</p>
<p>Understanding BIG-IP CPU usage</p>
<p>The following factors influence the manner in which TMM uses the CPU:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The number of processors installed in the BIG-IP system</li>
<li>The BIG-IP version</li>
<li>The modules for which the BIG-IP system is licensed</li>
</ul>
<p>CPU utilization on single CPU, single core systems</p>
<p>CPU resources are explicitly provisioned in the BIG-IP configuration.
When TMM is idle or processing low volumes of traffic, TMM yields idle
cycles to other processes.</p>
<p>CPU utilization on multi-CPU / multi-core systems</p>
<p>Prior to BIG-IP 11.5.0, each logical CPU core is assigned a separate TMM
instance, and each core processes both data plane (TMM-specific) tasks
and control plane (non-TMM-specific) tasks.</p>
<p>Beginning in BIG-IP 11.5.0, data plane tasks and control plane tasks use
separate logical cores on systems with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology
(HT Technology) CPUs. Even-numbered logical cores (hyperthreads) are
allocated to TMM, while odd numbered cores are available for other
processes.</p>
<p>Using the tmsh utility to view TMM CPU usage</p>

<p><strong>Understanding BIG-IP Memory usage</strong></p>
<p>When administering a BIG-IP system, it is important to understand how
the system allocates memory. In general, BIG-IP memory usage falls into
the following categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) memory usage</li>
<li>Linux host memory usage</li>
<li>Swap usage</li>
</ul>
<p>TMM runs as a real-time user process within the Linux host operating
system. The BIG-IP system statically assigns memory resources to TMM and
potentially to other module-related processes, depending on module
provisioning. The remaining memory is available for all other Linux host
processes.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system creates swap usage space during software installation
on disk. Swap space is available to the Linux kernel.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>TMM memory usage</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP data plane includes one or more TMM processes to manage
traffic on the BIG-IP system. The BIG-IP system statically assigns
memory resources to TMM.</p>
<p>The following information summarizes TMM memory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The BIG-IP system assigns a dedicated pool of memory to each TMM
process.</li>
<li>TMM memory is not available for the Linux kernel to reassign to other
host processes. The system never considers TMM memory as available.</li>
<li>TMM memory cannot be swapped to disk.</li>
<li>The TMM memory management subsystem allocates and clears memory pages
in the following manner:</li>
<li>TMM allocates static memory to hash tables (for example, the
connection flow table).</li>
<li>TMM dynamically allocates memory pages for temporary objects (for
example, persistence records and buffered connection data).</li>
<li>Memory sweepers periodically reap unused memory as needed from TMM
objects.</li>
<li>When possible, TMM caches dynamic allocations to improve performance
when new objects require the same allocations.</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Linux memory usage</strong></p>
<p>The system may allocate remaining memory to other processes on the Linux
host and kernel threads.</p>
<p>The following information summarizes Linux host memory usage:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Linux allocates most available memory to buffers and disk caching,
which gives the appearance of high memory usage but allows the system
to run more efficiently.</li>
<li>Linux utilities, such as top and free, may report that only a small
amount of memory is free. This is normal behavior; cached memory can
be reclaimed quickly if a program needs memory.</li>
<li>To see memory used by buffers and disk caching, view the -/+
buffers/cache row where top and free report these memory structures.
Add these values to the reported amount of free memory to estimate
the total amount of physical memory the processes are not currently
using.</li>
<li>The Linux kernel sometimes copies memory pages to swap. This is known
as swapping memory.</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Swap memory usage</strong></p>
<p>The following information summarizes swap memory usage:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is normal for a Linux system, including the BIG-IP system, to use
a small amount of swap. The Linux kernel sometimes prefers to swap
idle processes memory to disk so that more physical memory is
available for more active processes, buffers, and caches.</li>
<li>Physical memory is much faster than swap, and prioritizing buffers
and caches allows the kernel to optimize performance of disk-heavy
processes such as databases.</li>
<li>A higher percentage of swap use is normal when provisioned modules
make heavy use of the disk.</li>
<li>Excessive swap usage may be a sign that the system is experiencing
memory pressure. You should investigate in the following cases:</li>
<li>The system uses a very high percentage of swap memory.</li>
<li>The percentage of swap memory usage increases over time.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p><strong>Understanding BIG-IP memory statistics</strong></p>
<p>You can view BIG-IP memory statistics using BIG-IP utilities or Linux
command line utilities. It is normal for Linux utilities, such as top
and free, to report a small amount of free memory. This expected
behavior occurs due to Linux disk caching. F5 recommends that you use
the Configuration utility or the TMOS Shell (tmsh) to view memory
statistics on the BIG-IP system.</p>
<p>You can view BIG-IP memory statistics, including TMM memory usage, other
(Linux) memory usage, swap usage, and memory allocated to TMM hash
tables and cache objects. To do so, use the following utilities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>tmsh show /sys memory</li>
<li>Configuration utility: Statistics &gt; Module Statistics &gt; Memory</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Memory statistics (BIG-IP 10.x - 11.5.4)</strong></p>
<p>In BIG-IP 10.x - 11.5.4, the Configuration utility tmsh report memory
allocated to buffers and caches as used memory. As a result, it may
appear that the host system is using all available memory. The system
reports memory statistics in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>System Memory</li>
<li>Host Total: The amount of memory available to Linux or non-TMM
processes.</li>
<li>Host Used: The amount of memory in use by Linux or non-TMM processes.</li>
<li>TMM Total: The amount of memory available to TMM processes.</li>
<li>TMM Used: The amount of memory in use by TMM processes for traffic
management.</li>
<li>Subsystem memory/memory pool name</li>
<li>Indicates the name and memory utilization of TMM hash tables and
cache objects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.04 - Explain the effect of network failover settings on the LTM device</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-device-service-clustering-admin-11-5-0/8.html">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-device-service-clustering-admin-11-5-0/8.html</a></p>
<p><strong>What triggers failover?</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system initiates failover according to any of several events
that you define. These events fall into these categories:</p>
<p>System fail-safe</p>
<p>With system fail-safe, the BIG-IP system monitors various hardware
components, as well as the heartbeat of various system services. You can
configure the system to initiate failover whenever it detects a
heartbeat failure.</p>
<p>Gateway fail-safe</p>
<p>With gateway fail-safe, the BIG-IP system monitors traffic between an
active BIG-IP system in a device group and a pool containing a gateway
router. You can configure the system to initiate failover whenever some
number of gateway routers in a pool of routers becomes unreachable.</p>
<p>VLAN fail-safe</p>
<p>With VLAN fail-safe, the BIG-IP system monitors network traffic going
through a specified VLAN. You can configure the system to initiate
failover whenever the system detects a loss of traffic on the VLAN and
the fail-safe timeout period has elapsed.</p>
<p>HA groups</p>
<p>With an HA group, the BIG-IP system monitors trunk, pool, or cluster
health to create an HA health score for a device. You can configure the
system to initiate failover whenever the health score falls below
configurable levels.</p>
<p>Auto-failback</p>
<p>When you enable auto-failback, a traffic group that has failed over to
another device fails back to a preferred device when that device is
available. If you do not enable auto-failback for a traffic group, and
the traffic group fails over to another device, the traffic group
remains active on that device until that device becomes unavailable.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2397">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2397</a></p>
<p><strong>Network Failover</strong></p>
<p>Network failover is based on heartbeat detection where the system sends
heartbeat packets over the internal network.</p>
<p>The system uses the primary and secondary failover addresses to send
network failover heartbeat packets. For more information about the
BIG-IP mirroring and network failover transport protocols, refer to the
following articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K9057">K9057: Service port and protocol used for BIG-IP network
failover</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7225">K7225: Transport protocol used for BIG-IP connection and persistence
mirroring</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The BIG-IP system considers the peer down after the
Failover.NetTimeoutSec timeout value is exceeded. The default value of
Failover.NetTimeoutSec is three seconds, after which the standby unit
attempts to switch to an active state. The following database entry
represents the default settings for the failover time configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">Failover.NetTimeoutSec = 3</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Device Service Clustering (DSC) was introduced in BIG-IP 11.0.0 and
allows many new features such as synchronization and failover between
two or more devices. Network failover provides communication between
devices for synchronization, failover, and mirroring and is required for
the following deployments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sync-Failover device groups containing three or more devices</li>
<li>Active-active configurations between two BIG-IP platforms</li>
<li>BIG-IP VIPRION platforms</li>
<li>BIG-IP Virtual Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>An active-active pair must communicate over the network to indicate the
objects and resources they service. Otherwise, if network communications
fail, the two systems may attempt to service the same traffic management
objects, which could result in duplicate IP addresses on the network.</p>
<p>Network issues may cause BIG-IP systems to enter into active-active
mode. To avoid this issue, F5 recommends that you dedicate one interface
on each system to perform only failover communications and, when
possible, directly connect these two interfaces with an Ethernet cable
to avoid network problems that could cause the systems to go into an
active-active state.</p>
<p>Important: When you directly connect two BIG-IP systems with an Ethernet
cable, do not change the speed and duplex settings of the interfaces
involved in the connection. If you do, depending on the BIG-IP software
version, you may be required to use a crossover cable. For more
information, refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K9787">K9787: Auto MDI/MDIX behavior for BIG-IP
platforms</a>.</p>
<p>If you configure a BIG-IP high-availability pair to use network
failover, and the hardwired failover cable also connects the two units,
hardwired failover always has precedence; if network failover traffic is
compromised, the two units do not fail over because the hardwired
failover cable still connects them.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Hardwired failover</strong></p>
<p>Hardwired failover is also based on heartbeat detection, where one
BIG-IP system continuously sends voltage to another. If a response does
not initiate from one BIG-IP system, failover to the peer occurs in less
than one second. When BIG-IP redundant devices connect using a hardwired
failover cable, the system automatically enables hardwired failover.</p>
<p>The maximum hardwired cable length is 50 feet. Network failover is an
option if the distance between two BIG-IP systems exceeds the acceptable
length for a hardwired failover cable.</p>
<p>Note: For information about the failover cable wiring pinouts, refer to
K1426: Pinouts for the failover cable used with BIG-IP platforms.</p>
<p>Hardwired failover can only successfully be deployed between two
physical devices. In this deployment, hardwired failover can provide
faster failover response times than network failover.</p>
<p>Hardwired failover is only a heartbeat and carries no status
information. Communication over the network is necessary for certain
features to function properly. For example, Traffic Management
Microkernel (TMM) uses the network to synchronize packets and flow state
updates to peers for connection mirroring. To enable proper state
reporting and mirroring, F5 recommends that you configure network
failover in addition to hardwired failover.</p>

<p><strong>3.04 - Differentiate between unicast and multicast network failover modes</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2397">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2397</a></p>
<p><strong>Failover IP addresses</strong></p>
<p>These are the IP addresses that you want the BIG-IP system to use when
another device in the device group fails over to the local device. You
can specify two types of addresses: unicast and multicast.</p>
<p>For appliance platforms, specifying two unicast addresses should
suffice. For VIPRION platforms, you should also retain the default
multicast address that the BIG-IP system provides.</p>
<p>The recommended unicast addresses for failover are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The self IP address that you configured for either VLAN HA or VLAN
internal. If you created VLAN HA when you initially ran the Setup
utility on the local device, F5 recommends that you use the self IP
address for that VLAN. Otherwise, use the self IP address for VLAN
internal.</li>
<li>The IP address for the local management port.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K90231443">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K90231443</a></p>
<p><strong>Secure Network Failover</strong></p>
<p>When you configure BIG-IP device group members to use network failover,
the systems communicate over the configured failover addresses. By
default, the systems use UDP port 1026 for unicast network failover
traffic.</p>
<p>You can configure the BIG-IP system to pass network failover traffic
over a secure channel. When you enable the failover.secure db variable,
the system protects the failover connections to peer devices using DTLS
and certificate authentication. Configuring secure network failover
traffic may be beneficial when network traffic is configured to pass
over a public network.</p>
<p>You should be aware of the following when you configure the BIG-IP
system to pass network failover traffic over a secure channel:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Secure network failover requires that one or more unicast failover IP
address is defined for device group members.</li>
<li>Enabling secure network failover disables the multicast network
failover feature.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.04 - Identify the cause of failover using logs and statistics</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K95002127">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K95002127</a></p>
<p><strong>Reviewing the log files for failover messages</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system logs messages related to failover in the /var/log/ltm
file and the /var/log/audit file. After you locate a log message that
indicates a failover occurrence, you can review the log files
surrounding the failover event to help determine the cause of the
failover. To review log files related to failover issues, refer to the
following commands:</p>
<p>Impact of procedure: Performing the suggested actions should not have a
negative impact on your system.</p>
<p>To display the /var/log/ltm file, use a Linux command similar to the
following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>less /var/log/ltm
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To display log messages related to the system transitioning to an active
or standby state, use the grep or egrep commands to search for certain
patterns in the /var/log/ltm file similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>egrep -i <span class="s1">&#39;active|standby&#39;</span> /var/log/ltm
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To display the /var/log/audit log file, use a Linux command similar to
the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>less /var/log/audit
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To display log messages related to the system administratively
transitioning to a standby state, use the following egrep command to
search for patterns related to the device being placed in the standby
state in the /var/log/audit file.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>egrep -i <span class="s1">&#39;cmd_sod go standby|sys failover standby&#39;</span> /var/log/audit

<p><strong>DSC components</strong></p>
<p>DSC provides the foundation for centralized management and
high-availability features in BIG-IP 11.x, including the following
components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Device trust and trust domains</p>
<p>Device trust establishes trust relationships between BIG-IP devices
through certificate-based authentication. Each device generates a
device ID key and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate upon upgrade
or installation. A trust domain is a collection of BIG-IP devices
that trust each other, and can synchronize and fail over their
BIG-IP configuration data, as well as regularly exchange status and
failover messages.</p>
<p>When the local BIG-IP device attempts to join a device trust with a
remote BIG-IP device, the following applies:</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the local BIG-IP device is added as a peer authority device, the
remote BIG-IP device presents a certificate signing request (CSR) to
the local device, which then signs the CSR and returns the
certificate along with its CA certificate and key.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the local BIG-IP device is added as a subordinate (non-authority)
device, the remote BIG-IP device presents a CSR to the local device,
which then signs the CSR and returns the certificate. The CA
certificate and key are not presented to the remote BIG-IP device.
The subordinate device is unable to request other devices to join the
device trust.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Device groups</p>
<p>A device group is a collection of BIG-IP devices that reside in the
same trust domain and are configured to securely synchronize their
BIG-IP configuration and failover when needed. Device groups can
initiate a ConfigSync operation from the device group member with
the desired configuration change. You can create two types of device
groups:</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A Sync-Failover device group contains devices that synchronize
configuration data and support traffic groups for failover purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A Sync-Only device group contains devices that synchronize
configuration data, but do not synchronize failover objects and do
not fail over to other members of the device group.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Traffic groups</p>
<p>A traffic group represents a collection of related configuration
objects that are configured on a BIG-IP device. When a BIG-IP device
becomes unavailable, a traffic group can float to another device in
a device group.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Folders</p>
<p>A folder is a container for BIG-IP configuration objects. You can
use folders to set up synchronization and failover of configuration
data in a device group. You can sync all configuration data on a
BIG-IP device, or you can sync and fail over objects within a
specific folder only.</p>

<p><strong>Relationship between Device Trust and Device Group</strong></p>
<p>For a Big-IP device to be added to a Device Group there must be an
established trust between the devices in that Device Group and the new
device. This is done through certificate-based authentication between
the devices which establishes a Device Trust or trust domain.</p>

<p><strong>ConfigSync Failures</strong></p>
<p>F5 introduced the DSC architecture in BIG-IP 11.x. DSC provides the
framework for ConfigSync and other high availability (HA) features, such
as failover for BIG-IP device groups.</p>
<p>Note: The DSC technology is also referred to as centralized management
infrastructure (CMI).</p>
<p>This article provides steps to troubleshoot ConfigSync and the
underlying DSC components. DSC and ConfigSync include the following
elements:</p>
<p><strong>CMI communication channel</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system uses SSL certificates to establish a trust
relationship between devices. In a device trust, BIG-IP devices can act
as certificate signing authorities, peer authorities, or subordinate
non-authorities. When acting as a certificate signing authority, the
BIG-IP device signs x509 certificates for another BIG-IP device that is
in the local trust domain. The BIG-IP device for which a certificate
signing authority device signs its certificate is known as a subordinate
non-authority device. The BIG-IP system uses the following certificates
to establish a secure communication channel.</p>

<p>When the DSC components are properly defined, the device group members
establish a communication channel to accommodate device group
communication and synchronization. The CMI communication channel allows
the mcpd process that runs on the device group member to exchange MCP
messages and commit ID updates to determine which device has the latest
configuration and is eligible to synchronize its configuration to the
group. After the ConfigSync IP addresses are defined on each device, and
the device group is created, the devices establish the communication
channel, as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A user updates the configuration of a BIG-IP device group member
using the Configuration utility or TMOS Shell (tmsh).</li>
<li>The configuration change is communicated to the local mcpd process.</li>
<li>The mcpd process communicates the new configuration and commit ID to
the local TMM process.</li>
<li>The local TMM process sends the configuration and commit ID update to
remote TMM processes over the communication channel.</li>
<li>The remote TMM process translates the port to 6699 and connects to
its mcpd process.</li>
<li>The remote mcpd process loads the new configuration into memory, and
writes the configuration changes to the appropriate configuration
files.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Automatic Sync</strong></p>
<p>If you enable the Automatic Sync feature for a device group, the BIG-IP
system automatically synchronizes changes to a remote peer system’s
running configuration but does not save the changes to the configuration
files on the peer device. This behavior is by design and recommended for
larger configurations to avoid a long ConfigSync duration due to large
configurations.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may want to configure Automatic Sync to update the
running configuration and save the configuration to the configuration
files on the remote peer devices. For information, refer to K14624:
Configuring the Automatic Sync feature to save the configuration on the
remote devices.</p>
<p>Beginning in BIG-IP 11.4.0, the Automatic Sync feature is available for
both Sync-Only and Sync-Failover device groups. In addition, the
automatic sync behavior can be configured to be either full or
incremental. For more information, refer to K14809: Auto Sync is
possible for Sync-Failover device groups.</p>
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong></p>
<p>DSC and ConfigSync issues may result in the following symptoms:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Device group members have configuration discrepancies.</li>
<li>The system displays status messages that indicate a synchronization
or device trust issue.</li>
<li>The BIG-IP system logs error messages related to device trust or the
ConfigSync process.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Procedures</strong></p>
<p>When you investigate a possible device service clustering or ConfigSync
issue, you should first verify that the required configuration elements
are set for all device group members. If the required elements are set,
then attempt a ConfigSync operation. If ConfigSync fails, the BIG-IP
system generates Sync status messages that you can use to diagnose the
issue. Use the following procedures to troubleshoot DSC and ConfigSync:</p>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting a ConfigSync operation</strong></p>
<p>Attempt a ConfigSync operation to gather diagnostic information to help
you troubleshoot ConfigSync/DSC issues. To troubleshoot the ConfigSync
operation, perform the following procedures:</p>
<p><strong>Verifying the required elements for ConfigSync/DSC</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reviewing common reasons for ConfigSync failures</strong></p>
<p>If you experience ConfigSync issues after you first establish device
trust, after rebooting, or upgrading, review the following common
reasons for ConfigSync failure:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The devices have an IP address conflict</p>
<p>IP address conflicts are common causes of ConfigSync failure during
initial device group setup. If the ConfigSync or failover IP address
conflicts with another device, the systems will fail to establish a
trust relationship, ConfigSync operations will fail, and the systems
will fail to detect the active or next-active device. BIG-IP systems
experiencing an IP address conflict log error messages to the
/var/log/ltm file that appear similar to the following example:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">warning tmm[11178]: 01190004:4: address conflict detected for</span>
<span class="go">10.0.0.1 (00:0c:29:16:33:f6) on vlan 4093</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">One or more devices are not reachable on the network</p>
<p>Self IP addresses used for ConfigSync and failover must be routable
between device group members. Prior to establishing device trust,
make sure the devices are online and can communicate using the
defined self IP addresses. For example, make sure you can ping the
management IP address and ConfigSync IP addresses of other devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The software versions do not match</p>
<p>If you recently upgraded one of the device group members, you should
verify that the other device group members are also upgraded and
running the same software version. BIG-IP device group members must
run the same BIG-IP software version for ConfigSync operations to
work between group members; this includes the major, minor, and
maintenance software version numbers. By default, the hotfix and
point release version numbers are not required to match among device
group members when performing ConfigSync operations.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The BIG-IP configuration fails to load</p>
<p>If you experience ConfigSync issues after upgrading or loading a UCS
file on a device, verify whether the configuration failed to load.
To do so, type the following command from the command line, correct
reported validation errors, and attempt to reload the configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>tmsh load sys config verify
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Viewing the commit ID updates</strong></p>
<p>When you troubleshoot a ConfigSync issue, it is helpful to determine
which device group member has the latest commit ID update and contains
the most recent configuration. You can then decide whether to replicate
the newer configuration to the group, or perform a ConfigSync operation
that replicates an older configuration to the group, thus overwriting a
newer configuration.</p>
<p>To display the commit ID and the commit ID time stamps for the device
group, perform the following procedure:</p>
<p>Impact of procedure: Performing the following procedure should not have
a negative impact on your system.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Log in to the BIG-IP command line.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To display the commit IDs for the device group, type the following
command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>tmsh run /cm watch-devicegroup-device
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Locate the relevant device group and review the cid.id and cid.time
columns.</p>
<p>For example, the following output shows that the sync_test device
group has three members, and device bigip_a has the latest
configuration as indicated by the cid.id (commit ID number) and
cid.time (commit ID timestamp) columns:</p>
<div class="highlight-console notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="go">devices &lt;devgroup [device   cid.id   cid.orig   cid.time   last_sync</span>
<span class="go">20 21 sync_test   bigip_a   32731    bigip_a    14:27:00   : :</span>
<span class="go">20 21 sync_test   bigip_b   1745     bigip_a    13:39:24   13:42:04</span>
<span class="go">20 21 sync_test   bigip_c   1745     bigip_a    13:39:24   13:42:04</span>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Multiple devices with identical information are collapsed into
a single row that displays in green.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Perform steps 1 through 3 on all devices in the device group.</li>
<li>Compare the commit ID updates for each device with each device group

device is missing from the list, proceed to the Troubleshooting DSC
section.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Verifying a ConfigSync operation</strong></p>
<p>When troubleshooting a ConfigSync issue, attempt a ConfigSync operation
and verify the sync status message. If the ConfigSync operation fails,
the BIG-IP system generates a sync status message that you can use to
diagnose the issue. To attempt a ConfigSync operation, perform one of
the following three procedures:</p>
