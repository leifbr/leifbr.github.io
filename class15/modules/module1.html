<p><strong>BIG-IP Traffic Processing Order</strong></p>
<p>A couple of pretty interesting and useful videos on YouTube for
Packet Processing Order – for version 11.X - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYfcNIndSPQ&amp;t=47s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYfcNIndSPQ&amp;t=47s</a>
for version 12.X <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCLEw5xIZ7s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCLEw5xIZ7s</a></p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to go through version 12.X YouTube video as it talks about all the modules listed below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Packet Filter</li>
<li>AFM</li>
<li>FLOW_INIT (An iRule Event i.e. when FLOW_INIT)</li>
<li>LTM</li>
<li>APM</li>
<li>ASM</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Packet processing at different modules take place if the module is provisioned and configured.</p>
<p>FLOW_INIT</p>
<p>This event is triggered (once for TCP and unique UDP/IP flows) after packet filters, but before AFM, and TMM work occurs. The use cases for this event are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Override ACL action</li>
<li>Bandwidth control on both client/server flows</li>
<li>Routing to another Vip</li>
<li>Marking qos tos/dscp on both client/server flows</li>
</ul>
<p>Source - <a class="reference external" href="https://devcentral.f5.com/wiki/iRules.FLOW_INIT.ashx">https://devcentral.f5.com/wiki/iRules.FLOW_INIT.ashx</a></p>
<p>The packet is first evaluated by the Packet Filter The next is FLOW_INIT, then by AFM, then by LTM , then by APM.  And at last ASM processes the traffic, then hands the traffic back to LTM to finish up with. ASM sits off to
the side and either tells LTM to proceed or hands out a block page.</p>

<p>BIG-IP log types</p>
<p>Each type of event is stored locally in a separate log file, and the information stored in each log file varies depending on the event type. All log files for these event types are in the /var/log directory.</p>
<p>Type Description Log file</p>
<p><strong>audit:</strong> The audit event messages are messages that the BIG- /var/log/audit IP system logs as a result of changes to the BIG-IP system configuration. Logging audit events is optional.</p>
<p><strong>boot:</strong> The boot messages contain information that is logged /var/log/boot.log when the system boots.</p>
<p><strong>cron:</strong> When the cron daemon starts a cron job, the daemon /var/log/cron logs the information about the cron job in this file.</p>
<p><strong>daemon:</strong> The daemon messages are logged by various daemons /var/log/daemon.log that run on the system.</p>
<p><strong>dmesg:</strong> The dmesg messages contain kernel ring buffer /var/log/dmesg information that pertains to the hardware devices that the kernel detects during the boot process.</p>
<p><strong>GSLB:</strong> The GSLB messages pertain to global traffic /var/log/gtm management events.</p>
<p><strong>httpd:</strong> The httpd messages contain the Apache Web server /var/log/httpd/httpd_errors error log.</p>
<p><strong>kernel:</strong> The kernel messages are logged by the Linux kernel. /var/log/kern.log</p>
<p><strong>local traffic:</strong> The local traffic messages pertain specifically to the /var/log/ltm BIG-IP local traffic management events.</p>
<p><strong>mail:</strong> The mail messages contain the log information from the /var/log/maillog mail server that is running on the system.</p>
<p><strong>packet filter:</strong> The packet filter messages are those that result from /var/log/pktfilter the use of packet filters and packet-filter rules.</p>
<p><strong>security:</strong> The secure log messages contain information related to /var/log/secure authentication and authorization privileges.</p>
<p><strong>system:</strong> The system event messages are based on global Linux /var/log/messages events, and are not specific to BIG-IP local traffic management events.</p>
<p><strong>TMM:</strong> The TMM log messages are those that pertain to Traffic /var/log/tmm Management Microkernel events.</p>
<p><strong>user:</strong> The user log messages contain information about all /var/log/user.log user level logs.</p>
<p><strong>webui:</strong> The webui log messages display errors and exception /var/log/webui.log details that pertain to the Configuration utility.</p>

<p>When the BIG-IP system clock is not showing the correct timezone, or the date and time is not synchronized correctly, this could be caused by incorrect NTP configuration or a communication issue with a valid NTP peer server.</p>
<p>When verifying the NTP peer server communication, you can use the ntpq utility. The command generates output with the fields that are explained in the following table:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="5%" />
<col width="95%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><strong>Field</strong></th>
<th class="head"><strong>Definition</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>prefix to the remote field</td>
<td><ul class="first last simple">
<li>An asterisk (*) character indicates that the peer has been declared the system peer and lends its variables to the system variables.</li>
<li>A plus sign (+) indicates that the peer is a survivor and a candidate for the combining algorithm.</li>
<li>A space, x, period (.), dash (-), or hash (#) character indicates that this peer is not being used for synchronization because it either does not meet the requirements, is unreachable, or is not needed.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>remote</td>
<td>The remote field is the address of the remote peer.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>refid</td>
<td>The refid field is the Reference ID which identifies the server or reference clock with which the remote peer synchronizes, and its interpretation depends on the value of the stratum field (explained in the st definition). For stratum 0 (unspecified or invalid), the refid is an ascii value used for debugging. Example: INIT or STEP. For stratum 1 (reference clock), the refid is an ascii value used to specify the type of external clock source. Example: NIST refers to NIST telephone modem. For strata 2 through 15, the refid is the address of the next lower stratum server used for synchronization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>st</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>st</strong> field is the stratum of the remote peer. Primary servers (servers with an external reference clock such as GPS) are assigned stratum 1. A secondary NTP server which synchronizes with a stratum 1 server is assigned stratum 2. A secondary NTP server which synchronizes with a stratum 2 server is assigned stratum 3. Stratum 16 is referred to as “MAXSTRAT,” is customarily mapped to stratum value 0, and therefore indicates being unsynchronized. Strata 17 through 255 are reserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>t</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>t</strong> field is the type of peer: local, unicast, multicast, or broadcast.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>when</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>when</strong> field is the time since the last response to a poll was received (in seconds).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>poll</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>poll</strong> field is the polling interval (in seconds). This value starts low (example: 64) and over time, as no changes are detected, this polling value increases incrementally to the configured max polling value (example: 1024).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>reach</strong></td>
<td>The <strong>reach</strong> field is the reachability register. The octal shift register records results of the last eight poll attempts.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>&#160;</td>
<td>&#160;</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>delay</strong></td>
<td>The delay field is the current estimated delay; the transit time between these peers in milliseconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>offset</strong></td>
<td>The offset field is the current estimated offset; the time difference between these peers in milliseconds.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>jitter</strong></td>
<td>The jitter field is the current estimated dispersion; the variation in delay between these peers in milliseconds.</td>
</tr>

<p>If the local <strong>ntpd</strong> process can communicate, or attempts to
communicate with a declared NTP peer server, the output from the
<strong>ntpq</strong> command appears like the following example:</p>
<p># ntpq -np
remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter
172.28.4.133 10.10.10.251 4 u 482 1024 377 0.815 -10.010 0.345</p>
<p>In the previous example, the remote server information refid, stratum,
delay, offset, jitter displays, indicating that the servers are successfully
exchanging information. The value of <strong>377</strong> in the <strong>reach</strong> column
indicates that the server was successfully reached during each of the last
eight attempts, and the value of <strong>482</strong> in the <strong>when</strong> column indicates
that the last response was received from the remote peer 482 seconds ago,
which is within the polling interval of 1024 seconds.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Example of a failed NTP peer server query</p>
<p>If the local <strong>ntpd</strong> process fails to communicate with an NTP peer
server, the output from the <strong>ntpq</strong> command may appear similar to the
following example:</p>
<p># ntpq -np remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter
172.28.4.133 .INIT. 16 u - 64 0 0.000 0.000 0000.00</p>
<p><em>Note: An **st*</em> (stratum) of <strong>16</strong> means that the destination NTP
server is unreachable or is not considered a viable candidate.*</p>
<p>In this example, the remote server information (<strong>refid</strong>, <strong>stratum</strong>,
<strong>delay</strong>, <strong>offset</strong>, <strong>jitter</strong>) is not available. The value
<strong>.INIT.</strong> in the <strong>refid</strong> column indicates that NTP is initializing,
and the server has not yet been reached. The value of <strong>0</strong> (zero) in
the <strong>reach</strong> column indicates that the server has not been reached
during any of the last eight attempts. The absence of a value in the
<strong>when</strong> column indicates that no data has been received from the remote
peer since the local <strong>ntpd</strong> process was started. The <strong>poll</strong> value of
<strong>64</strong> is still at the MINPOLL value, which indicates that NTP was
recently restarted.</p>
<p>NTP has a MINPOLL and MAXPOLL value, which it uses to determine the
optimal time between updates with the reference server. If <strong>jitter</strong> is
low, and there are no changes in data received, NTP automatically
incrementally increases the <strong>poll</strong> value until it reaches MAXPOLL, or
1024 seconds.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Example of a successful NTP preferred peer server query</p>
<p>If the local <strong>ntpd</strong> process communicates or attempts to communicate
with a declared <strong>preferred</strong> NTP peer server, the output from the
<strong>ntpq</strong> command appears similar to the following example:</p>
<p># ntpq -np</p>
<p>remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter
172.28.4.133 10.10.10.251 4 u 482 1024 377 0.815 -10.010 0.345
172.28.4.134 10.10.10.252 6 u 482 1024 179 0.215 -1.010 0.545</p>
<p>In the previous example, <strong>172.28.4.133</strong> is the preferred server, or
current time source, and is designated by the backslash symbol. Any
remaining servers available for use are indicated by the ‘+’ symbol.
When initially configured, NTPd can take up to a few minutes to
calculate and designate the current preferred time source.</p>

<p>MEMCACHE</p>
<p>Source -
<a class="reference external" href="https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/the-power-of-the-proxy-request-routing-memcached">https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/the-power-of-the-proxy-request-routing-memcached</a></p>
<p>By definition, <strong>Memcached</strong> is a general-purpose distributed memory
caching system. It is often used to speed up dynamic database-driven
websites by caching data and objects in RAM to reduce the number of
times an external data source (such as a database or API) must be read.</p>
<p>As an example, Memcache is like load balancing Bluecoat (forward proxy)
systems behind F5 systems using the CARP algorithm. Where one or
Bluecoat Systems as a pool member will be load balanced and Bluecoat
will not only send the web traffic outside, but also caches the
responses to serve better experience to the users. Btw, Bluecoat as a
vendor uses Memcache and other variant of the same for serving web
content faster.</p>
<p>Similarly, F5 Administrator can have any other caching server or server
farm as pool.</p>
<p>A good example of real time MEMCACHED users are facebook, google,
salesforce and most of the social media websites.</p>
<p>However Memcache also has its own limitation. Any shared instance of
memcache is insecure today. memcache doesn’t have a way to Authenticate
which means that:</p>
<p>user1 can read anything user2 ’caches’ it also means that user1 can
write anything that user2 reads (cache poisoning)</p>
<p>Even with latest version SASL authentication — you are authenticating
to the whole cache, and can still read poison someone else’s data.</p>

<p>Creating a custom client-side ICAP profile</p>
<p>You create this ICAP profile when you want to use an ICAP server to wrap
an HTTP request in an ICAP message before the BIG-IP system sends the
request to a pool of web servers. The profile specifies the HTTP
request-header values that the ICAP server uses for the ICAP message.</p>
<p>After you create the ICAP profile, you can assign it to an internal
virtual server so that the HTTP request that the BIG-IP system sends to
an ICAP server is wrapped in an ICAP message, as per the settings you
specified in the ICAP profile.</p>

<p>You create a Request Adapt type of profile when you want a standard HTTP
virtual server to forward HTTP requests to an internal virtual server
that references a pool of ICAP servers. A Request Adapt type of profile
instructs the HTTP virtual server to send an HTTP request to a named
internal virtual server for possible request modification.</p>
<p>After you perform this task, the BIG-IP system contains a Request Adapt
profile that a standard HTTP virtual server can use to forward an HTTP
request to an internal virtual server for ICAP traffic.</p>

<p>HttpWatch integrates with Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox to
provide unrivaled levels of HTTP monitoring, without the need for
separately configured proxies or network sniffers. Simply interact with
a web site and HttpWatch will display a log of requests and responses
alongside the web page itself. It even shows interactions between the
browser and its cache. Each HTTP transaction can be examined to see the
values of headers, cookies, query strings and other HTTP related data.</p>
<p>Commercial web sites often use technologies such as HTTP compression,
SSL encryption and chunked encoding to provide the best levels of
security and performance. HttpWatch works with these technologies to
provided a detail view of HTTP activity within Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>HttpWatch has two components; a plug-in used to collect, view and save
HTTP traffic within IE or Firefox, and a standalone log file viewer know
as HttpWatch Studio.</p>

branded credit cards from the major card schemes including Visa,
MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB. The PCI Standard is
mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card
Industry Security Standards Council. The standard was created to
increase controls around cardholder data to reduce credit card fraud.
Validation of compliance is performed annually, either by an external
Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or by a firm specific Internal
Security Assessor (ISA) that creates a Report on Compliance (ROC) for
organizations handling large volumes of transactions, or by Self-
Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for companies handling smaller volumes.</p>
<p>Requirements</p>
<p>The PCI Data Security Standard specifies twelve requirements for
compliance, organized into six logically related groups called “control
objectives”.</p>
<p>Each version of PCI DSS has divided these twelve requirements into a
number of sub-requirements differently, but the twelve high-level
requirements have not changed since the inception of the standard.</p>

<p><strong>DAST – Dynamic Application Security Testing</strong></p>
<p>Dynamic application security testing, is essentially a tool set for
finding and the remediation of vulnerabilities in a web-based
application. Essentially, you open up a DAST tool and feed it a url to a
website or a web service, this includes web-based applications. The tool
will first crawl the site, much like a search engine, and index the
entire site. Then it will use this information to build out a site map
and learn how to move around the site, sometimes in ways the developer
didn’t intend. After figuring out ways to traverse the site, the tool
will spend the bulk of its time performing attacks against the site.
This includes all of the major attack types: sql injection, cross site
request forgery, cross site scripting, etc., and practically any other
vulnerability you can think of.</p>

<p>Advanced DAST integrations can scan web apps and coordinate with BIG-IP
ASM to patch vulnerabilities in minutes. By integrating contextual
information about incoming IP addresses and IP Intelligence service
databases, BIG-IP ASM secures applications against constantly changing
threats.</p>

<p><strong>CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability)</strong> - Also known as
the CIA triad, is a model designed to guide policies for information
security within an organization. The model is also sometimes referred to
as the AIC triad (availability, integrity and confidentiality) to avoid
confusion with the Central Intelligence Agency. The elements of the
triad are considered the three most crucial components of security.</p>
<p>In this context, confidentiality is a set of rules that limits access to
information, integrity is the assurance that the information is
trustworthy and accurate, and availability is a guarantee of reliable
access to the information by authorized people.</p>

<p><strong>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</strong></p>
<p>Client-side traffic refers to connections between a client system and
the BIG-IP system. Server-side traffic refers to connections between the
BIG-IP system and a target server system:</p>
<p><strong>Managing client-side SSL traffic</strong></p>
<p>When you enable the BIG-IP system to manage client-side SSL traffic, the
BIG-IP system terminates incoming SSL connections by decrypting the
client request. The BIG-IP system then sends the request, in clear text,
to a target server. Next, the BIG-IP system retrieves a clear-text
response (such as a web page) and encrypts the request, before sending
the web page back to the client. During the process of terminating an
SSL connection, the BIG-IP system can, as an option, perform all the SSL
certificate verification functions normally handled by the target web
server.</p>
<p><strong>Managing server-side SSL traffic</strong></p>
<p>When you enable the BIG-IP system to manage server-side SSL traffic, the
BIG-IP system enhances the security of your network by re-encrypting a
decrypted request before sending it on to a target server. In addition
to this re-encryption, the BIG-IP system can, as an option, perform the
same verification functions for server certificates that the BIG-IP
system can for client certificates.</p>
<p><strong>SSL Bridging</strong></p>
<p>Source - <a class="reference external" href="https://f5.com/glossary/ssl-bridging">https://f5.com/glossary/ssl-bridging</a></p>
<p>SSL bridging is a process where a device, usually located at the edge of
a network, decrypts SSL traffic and then re-encrypts it before sending
it on to the Web server. SSL bridging can be useful when the edge device
performs deep-packet inspection to verify that the contents of the
SSL-encrypted transmission are safe, or if there are security concerns
about unencrypted traffic traversing the internal network.</p>
<p><strong>SSL Offloading / Termination</strong></p>
<p>Source - <a class="reference external" href="https://f5.com/glossary/ssl-offloading">https://f5.com/glossary/ssl-offloading</a></p>
<p>SSL offloading relieves a Web server of the processing burden of
encrypting and/or decrypting traffic sent via SSL, the security protocol
that is implemented in every Web browser. The processing is offloaded to
a separate device designed specifically to perform SSL acceleration or
SSL termination.</p>
<p>SSL termination capability is particularly useful when used in
conjunction with clusters of SSL VPNs, because it greatly increases the
number of connections a cluster can handle.</p>
<p>BIG-IP® Local Traffic Manager with the SSL Acceleration Feature Module
performs SSL offloading.</p>
<p><strong>SSL Bypass / Pass through</strong></p>
<p>For compliance, any other security reason or any custom requirement, you
may need to use SSL Bypass feature on F5 LTM. In this case, you don’t
terminate the connection on F5 hence have minimal control to manipulate
the stream of the traffic, however you can still retain Load Balancing
and other L3-L4 features in place. In such scenario, content hosting or
any other device in between is processing the SSL traffic, and F5 is
just load balancing / packet switching / forwarding &amp; receiving the
traffic, without any visibility on stream or application traffic.</p>

BIG-IP Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) profiles can use ciphers from two
different SSL stacks;</p>
<p>The NATIVE stack is built into the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM),
and the COMPAT stack is based on the OpenSSL library.</p>
<p>The NATIVE stack is an optimized SSL stack that the BIG-IP system can
use to leverage hardware acceleration for most SSL ciphers. F5
recommends that you use the NATIVE stack because it is suitable for most
SSL connections.</p>
<p><strong>Default cipher list for SSL profiles</strong></p>
<p>When you configure an SSL profile on the BIG-IP system, you can manually
specify the ciphers available for SSL connections, or you can use the
default cipher string, DEFAULT. The default cipher string only uses SSL
ciphers from the NATIVE SSL stack.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use the <strong>!</strong> symbol preceding a cipher, the SSL
profile permanently removes the cipher from the cipher list, even if it
is explicitly stated later in the cipher string. When you use the <strong>–</strong>
symbol preceding a cipher, the SSL profile removes the cipher from the
cipher list, but it can be added back to the cipher list if there are
later options that allow it.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:
To remove SSLv2 from the DEFAULT SSL profile, you can use the
following cipher string in the SSL Profile.</p>
<p>DEFAULT:!SSLv2</p>
<p>F5 recommends that you use the DEFAULT cipher string for Client and
Server SSL profiles. However, you can configure an SSL profile to use a
custom cipher suite. By applying different profiles to different virtual
servers, you can make Client SSL virtual servers more or less permissive
than others.</p>
<p>For example, you can use this approach to allow only strong ciphers,
thereby enforcing the PCI requirement for strong cryptography and
eliminating Weak Supported SSL Ciphers Suite violations.</p>

<p>The <strong>ssldump</strong> utility is an SSL/TLS network protocol analyzer, which
identifies TCP connections from a chosen packet trace or network
interface and attempts to interpret them as SSL/TLS traffic. When
the <strong>ssldump</strong> utility identifies SSL/TLS traffic, it decodes the
records and displays them in text to standard output. If provided with
the private key that was used to encrypt the connections, the
<strong>ssldump</strong> utility may also be able to decrypt the connections and
display the application data traffic.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>ssldump</strong> utility to examine, decrypt, and decode
SSL-encrypted packet streams managed by the BIG-IP system. The
<strong>ssldump</strong> utility can act on packet streams real-time as they
traverse the system, or on a packet capture file saved in the
<strong>libpcap</strong> format, such as that produced by the <strong>tcpdump</strong> utility.
Although it is possible for the <strong>ssldump</strong> utility to decode and
display live traffic real-time as it traverses the BIG-IP system, it
is rarely the most effective method to examine the voluminous and
complex output of the <strong>ssldump</strong> utility. Capturing the target traffic
to a file using the <strong>tcpdump</strong> utility, then decoding the file using
the <strong>ssldump</strong> utility offers a better opportunity to examine the
traffic in detail.</p>

<p>Scenario 1: Virtual server missing a client SSL profile</p>
<p>The client SSL profile defines what certificate and private key to use,
a key passphrase if needed, allowed ciphers, and a number of other
options related to TLS communications. Without a client SSL profile, a
virtual server has no knowledge of any of the parameters necessary to
create a TLS session. After you’ve configured a few hundred HTTPS
virtual servers this configuration step becomes automatic, but most of
us mortals have missed step at one point or another and left ourselves
scratching our heads.</p>
<p>We’ll set up a test virtual that has all the necessary configuration
options for an HTTPS profile, except for the omission of the client SSL
profile. The client will open a connection to the virtual on port 443, a
TCP connection will be established, and the client will send a
‘ClientHello’. Normally the server would then respond with ServerHello,
but in this case there is no response and after some period of time (5
minutes is the default timeout for the browser) the connection is
closed. This is what the ssldump would look like for a missing client
SSL profile:</p>
<p>New TCP connection #1: 10.0.0.10(46226) &lt;-&gt; 10.0.0.20(443) 1 1 0.0011
(0.0011) C&gt;SV3.1(84) Handshake</p>

<p>1 299.9883 (0.0000) S&gt;C TCP FIN</p>
<p>Scenario 2: Client and server do not share a common cipher suite</p>
<p>This is a common scenario when really old browsers try to connect to
servers with modern cipher suites. We have purposely configured our SSL
profile to only accept one cipher suite (TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_
SHA in this case). When we try connect to the virtual using a 128-bit
key, the connection is immediately closed with no ServerHello from the
virtual server. The differentiator here, while small, is the quick
closure of the connection and the ‘TCP FIN’ that arises from the server.
This is unlike the behavior of the missing SSL profile, because the
server initiates the connection teardown and there is no connection
timeout. The differences, while subtle, hint at the details of the
problem:</p>
<p>New TCP connection #1: 10.0.0.10(49342) &lt;-&gt; 10.0.0.20(443) 1 1 0.0010
(0.0010) C&gt;SV3.1(48) Handshake</p>

<p>Types of resource records</p>
<p>This section describes the common resource records that the ZoneRunner
utility supports. For information on additional resource record types,
see <strong>DNS and BIND</strong>, 4th edition, Albitz and Liu.</p>
<p>The types of resource records are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SOA (Start of authority)
The start of authority resource record, SOA, starts every zone
file and indicates that a name server is the best source of information
for a particular zone. The SOA record indicates that a name server is
authoritative for a zone. There must be exactly one SOA record per zone.
Unlike other resource records, you create a SOA record only when you
create a new master zone file.</li>
<li>A (Address)
The Address record, or A record, lists the IP address for a given
host name. The name field is the hosts name, and the address is the
network interface address. There should be one A record for each
IP address of the machine.</li>
<li>AAAA (IPv6 Address)
The IPv6 Address record, or AAAA record, lists the 128-bit IPv6
address for a given host name.</li>
<li>CNAME (Canonical Name)
The Canonical Name resource record, CNAME, specifies an alias or
nickname for the official, or canonical, host name. This record must
be the only one associated with the alias name. It is usually easier
to supply one A record for a given address and use CNAME records to
define alias host names for that address.</li>
<li>DNAME (Delegation of Reverse Name)
The Delegation of Reverse Name resource record, DNAME, specifies the
reverse lookup of an IPv6 address. These records substitute the
suffix of one domain name with another. The DNAME record instructs the
Global Traffic Manager (or any DNS server) to build an alias that
substitutes a portion of the requested IP address with the data stored
in the DNAME record.</li>
<li>HINFO (Host Information)
The Host Information resource record, HINFO, contains information
on the hardware and operating system relevant to the Global Traffic
Manager (or other DNS).</li>
<li>MX (Mail Exchanger)
The Mail Exchange resource record, MX, defines the mail system(s)
for a given domain.</li>
<li>NS (Name Server)
The name server resource record, NS, defines the name servers for
a given domain, creating a delegation point and a subzone. The first
<strong>name</strong> field specifies the zone that is served by the name server that
is specified in the <strong>name servers</strong> name field. Every zone needs at
least one name server.</li>
<li>PTR (Pointer)
A name pointer resource record, PTR, associates a host name with
a given IP address. These records are used for reverse name lookups.</li>
<li>SRV (Service)
The Service resource record, SRV, is a pointer that allows an
alias for a given service to be redirected to another domain. For example,
if the fictional company SiteRequest had an FTP archive hosted on
<strong>archive.siterequest.com</strong>, the IT department can create an SRV record
that allows an alias, <strong>ftp.siterequest.com</strong> to be redirected to
<strong>archive.siterequest.com</strong>.</li>
<li>TXT (Text)
The Text resource record, TXT, allows you to supply any string of
information, such as the location of a server or any other relevant
information that you want available.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>DNSSEC</em></p>
<p>A good introductory read on DNSSEC - <a class="reference external" href="https://ds9a.nl/dnssec/">https://ds9a.nl/dnssec/</a></p>
<p>To validate the DNSSEC Domains using the “Dig” tool, you can use the
<strong>+dnssec</strong> argument. If the domain’s RRs are signed by DNSSEC, you
should see “<strong>ad</strong>” (Authentication Data, rfc 2535) flag set in the
response. However, an RFC was written later stating that “ad” flag is
not useful in DNS Security Extension (rfc 3655).</p>

<p>The requirements for using IP address intelligence are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The system must have an IP Intelligence license.</li>
<li>The system must have an Internet connection either directly or
through a proxy server.</li>
<li>The system must have DNS configured.</li>
<li>If the BIG-IP system is behind a firewall, make sure that the BIG-IP
system has external access to vector.brightcloud.com using port 443.
That is the IP Intelligence server from which the system gets IP
Intelligence information.</li>
</ul>
<p>To check the reputation of any specific IP address, you can follow the

<p>REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE</p>
<p>The Four Categories of DDoS</p>
<p>While the DDoS threat landscape is constantly evolving, F5 has found
that attacks continue to fall within four attack types: volumetric,
asymmetric, computational, and vulnerability-based. These attack
categories have the following characteristics:</p>
<p><strong>Volumetric</strong> —Flood-based attacks that can be at layer 3, 4, or 7.
<strong>Asymmetric</strong> —Attacks designed to invoke timeouts or session-state changes.
<strong>Computational</strong> —Attacks designed to consume CPU and memory.
<strong>Vulnerability-based</strong> —Attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities.</p>

<p><em>Multi-Tier DDoS Protection Architecture</em></p>
<p>F5 recommends a hybrid cloud on-premises DDoS solution. Volumetric
attacks will be mitigated by <strong>F5 Silverline</strong> TM DDoS Protection —a
service delivered via the F5 Silverline cloud-based platform.</p>
<p>Silverline DDoS Protection will analyze and remove the bulk of the
attack traffic. Sometimes, a DDoS campaign may include application layer
attacks that must be addressed on premises. These asymmetric and
computational attacks can be mitigated using the network defense and
application defense tiers. The network defense tier is composed of layer
3 and 4 network firewall services and simple load balancing to the
application defense tier. The application defense tier consists of more
sophisticated (and also more CPU-intensive) services including SSL
termination and a web application firewall stack.</p>

<p><strong>Ready Defense subscription as a backup cloud-scrubbing service</strong></p>
<p>Many customers already have an agreement with an external DDoS scrubbing
service. These organizations can also benefit from having a backup
scrubbing service. Silverline DDoS Protection can be used in this manner
with its Ready DefenseTM subscription. As the organization’s primary
DDoS scrubber, Ready Defense can take over to either assist or
completely mitigate the attack.</p>
<p><strong>Always Available subscription as the primary service</strong></p>
<p>Organizations can use the Silverline DDoS Protection Always AvailableTM
subscription as their primary service to respond to DDoS attacks. They
can replace their existing primary service or delegate their existing
service to be the secondary service.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment models</strong></p>
<p>Silverline DDoS Protection has two main deployment models: routed
configuration and F5 IP ReflectionTM.</p>
<p>Routed configuration is for enterprises that need to protect their
entire network infrastructure. Silverline DDoS Protection leverages
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to route all the traffic to its scrubbing
and protection center, and utilizes a Generic Routing Encapsulation
(GRE) tunnel to send the clean traffic back to the origin network.
Routed configuration is a scalable design for enterprises with large
network deployments. It does not require any application-specific
configuration and provides an easy option to turn on or off Silverline
DDoS Protection.</p>
<p>IP Reflection is an alternative asymmetric technique to provide network
infrastructure protection without the need for GRE tunnels.
Organizations with devices that support destination NAT can leverage IP
Reflection. With IP Reflection, there is no need to change any IP
address and the IP address space is not affected as it is with GRE.</p>
<p><strong>Return traffic methods used by Silverline DDoS Protection include:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(AWS) Direct Connect</li>
<li>IP Reflection</li>
<li>GRE tunnels</li>
<li>Proxy</li>
<li>Customer bundles (fiber)

<p>The BIG-IP Network Firewall provides policy-based access control to and
from address and port pairs inside and outside of your network. By
default the network firewall is configured in ADC mode, which is a
default allow configuration, in which all traffic is allowed through the
firewall, and any <strong>traffic you want to block must be explicitly
specified</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Firewall Mode</strong></p>

<p>The BIG-IP Advanced Firewall Module (AFM) provides policy-based access
control to and from address and port pairs, inside and outside of your
network. In this scenario, the network firewall is configured in
Firewall mode, a default deny configuration, in which all traffic is
blocked through the firewall, and any <strong>traffic you want to allow must

<p>The Classification Module has 2 components,</p>
<p><strong>Compiler</strong> – Resides in the “Control plane” and compiles the
connection table based on the policy is configured.</p>
<p><strong>Classification Engine</strong> – Uses the Compiled Classifier to determine the
set of rules matching a packet based on the packet contents and other

<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>The category of object to which the rule applies. Rules can be Global
and apply to all addresses on the BIG-IP system that match the rule, or
they can be specific, applying only to a specific virtual server, self
IP address, route domain, or the management port.</p>
<p><em>Context</em> is processed in this order:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Global</li>
<li>Route domain</li>
<li>Virtual server/self IP Global drop or reject*</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can configure the global drop or reject context. The
global drop or reject context is the final context for all traffic,
except Management port traffic. Note that even though it is a global
context, it is not processed first, like the main global context, but
last. If a packet matches no rule in any previous context, the global
drop or reject rule rejects the traffic. The default global rule is
global reject. *</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Management port traffic is not affected by the global drop or
reject rule, or by global rules in general. Management port rules must
be specifically configured and applied. *</p>
<p>The above example shows the “<strong>Context</strong>” of the multiple rules
configured in the AFM System. The “Contexts” in the above example are
“Global, Virtual Server, and Default”.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong> ICMP is handled by the BIG-IP system at the global or
route domain level. Because of this, ICMP messages receive a response
before they reach the virtual server context. You cannot create rule for
ICMP or ICMPv6 on a self IP or virtual server context. You can apply a
rule list to a self IP or virtual server that includes a rule for ICMP
or ICMPv6; however, such a rule will be ignored. To apply firewall
actions to the ICMP protocol, create a rule with the global or route
domain context. ICMP rules are evaluated only for ICMP forwarding
requests, and not for the IP addresses of the BIG-IP system itself.</p>
<p>When you create rules on the network firewall, it is possible that a
rule can either overlap or conflict with an existing rule.</p>
<p><strong>Redundant rule</strong></p>
<p>A rule which has address, user, region, or port information that
completely overlaps with another rule, <strong>with the same action</strong>. In the
case of a redundant rule, the rule can be removed with no net change in
packet processing because of the overlap with a previous rule or rules.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting rule</strong></p>
<p>A conflicting rule is a special case of a redundant rule, in which
address, user, region or port information overlaps with another rule,
but the rules <strong>have different actions</strong>, and thus conflict.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> A rule might be called conflicting even if the result of each
rule is the same. For example, a rule that applies to a specific IP
address is considered in conflict with another rule that applies to the
same IP address, if one has an Accept action and the other has an
action of Accept Decisively, even though the two rules accept
packets.</p>
<p>On a rule list page, redundant or conflicting rules are indicated in the
State column with either (Redundant) or (Conflicting).</p>

<p><strong>Attack type</strong> – Defines the type of attack and sub-categories of the
same.</p>
<p><strong>Detection Threshold PPS</strong> – An alert. When the particular type of
Category reaches to the defined “Detection of Threshold PPS”, it
generates an alert (if you’ve configured external logging server with
AFM, else local logging).</p>
<p><strong>Detection Threshold Percent</strong> – Additional flag to determine the
further aggressiveness of the attack, of a particular type of category.
Here, AFM compares the current rate of the particular Category type’s
attack with Last One Hour average packet rate. For example, if the
average rate for the last hour is 1000 packets per second, and you set
the percentage increase threshold to 100, an attack is detected at 100
percent above the average, or 2000 packets per second. When the
threshold is passed, an attack is logged and reported. The system then
automatically institutes a rate limit equal to the average for the last
hour, and all packets above that limit are dropped. The system continues
to check every second until the incoming packet rate drops below the
percentage increase threshold. Rate limiting continues until the rate
drops below the specified limit.</p>
<p><strong>Default Internal Rate Limit</strong> - Use <strong>Specify</strong> to set a value, in
packets per second, which cannot be exceeded by packets of this type.
All packets of this type over the threshold are dropped. Rate limiting
continues until the rate drops below the specified limit again.</p>
<p>Use <strong>Infinite</strong> to set No value for the threshold. This specifies that
this type of attack is not rate-limited.</p>

<p><strong>Data guard Protection</strong></p>
<p>Source -
<a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_asm/manuals/product/asm">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_asm/manuals/product/asm</a>-
implementations-11-5-0/9.html</p>
<p>In some web applications, a response may contain sensitive user
information, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers
(U.S. only). The Data Guard feature can prevent responses from exposing
sensitive information by masking the data (this is also known as
response scrubbing).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you mask the data, the system replaces the sensitive data
with asterisks (****). F5 recommends that you enable this
setting especially when the security policy enforcement mode is
transparent. Otherwise, when the system returns a response, sensitive
data could be exposed to the client.</p>
<p>Using Data Guard, you can configure custom patterns using PCRE regular
expressions to protect other forms of sensitive information, and
indicate exception patterns not to consider sensitive. You can also
specify which URLs you want the system to examine for sensitive data.</p>
<p>The system can examine the content of responses for specific types of
files that you do not want to be returned to users, such as ELF binary
files or Microsoft Word documents. File content checking causes the
system to examine responses for the file content types you select, and
to block sensitive file content (depending on the blocking modes), but
it does not mask the sensitive file content.</p>
<p>Data Guard examines responses that have the following content-type
headers: • “text/…”</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“application/x-shockwave-flash” • “application/sgml”</li>
<li>“application/x-javascript”</li>
<li>“application/xml”</li>
<li>“application/x-asp”</li>
<li>“application/x-aspx”</li>
<li>“application/xhtml+xml”</li>
</ul>
<p>You can configure one additional user-defined response content-type
using the system variable user_defined_accum_type. If response
logging is enabled, these responses can also be logged.</p>
<p><em>DoS Protection</em></p>
<p>There are two types of protections you can implement for DoS in ASM.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>TPS Based DoS Protection</li>
<li>Stress Based (formally known as “Latency based”) DoS Protection</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The averages for IP address and URL counts are done for each
virtual server, not each DoS L7 profile, in case one DoS L7 profile is
assigned to more than one virtual server. *</p>
<p>TPS Based Anomaly Protection</p>
<p>TPS Based DoS Protection detects DoS attacks from the client side using
the following calculations:  <strong>Transaction rate during detection
interval</strong></p>
<p>The average number of requests per second <strong>sent for</strong> a specific URL,
or <strong>sent by</strong> a specific IP address. <strong>Every second</strong>, the system
calculates the average TPS for the last minute (i.e. Last 60 seconds).</p>
<p>Here are some interesting facts about the TPS calculations. As there are
two types of TPS detection, there are two different calculations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Transaction rate detection interval</li>
<li>Transaction rate history interval</li>
</ul>
<p>For “Transaction rate detection interval”, the ASM calculates short
average for the past 1min, and for “Transaction rate history
interval”, the ASM calculates long average for the past 1hour. Let’s
discuss this in a little detail, read the below.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction rate detection interval:</strong> The average number of
requests per second sent, and it is updated every 60 seconds.</p>
<p>BIG-IP ASM calculates short average for the past 1min. It will be
calculated <strong>1 sec later</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong></p>
<p>At 8:59:59 am, it is calculated short average per 1min between
8:58:58 am and 8:59:58 am. At 9:00:00 am, it is calculated short
average per 1min between 8:58:59 am and 8:59:59 am. At 9:00:01 am,
it is calculated short average per 1min between 8:59:00 am and
9:00:00 am. At 9:00:02 am, it is calculated short average per 1min
between 8:59:01 am and 9:00:01 am.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction rate history interval:</strong> The average number of
transactions for the past hour, and it is updated every minute (i.e.
60 seconds).</p>
<p>BIG-IP ASM calculates long average the past 1hour. It will be
calculated <strong>1min later</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For example</strong></p>
<p>At 8:59:00 am, it is calculated long average per 1hour between 7:58:00
am and 8:58:00 am. At 9:00:00 am, it is calculated long average per
1hour between 7:59:00 am and 8:59:00 am. At 9:01:00 am, it is calculated
long average per 1hour between 8:00:00 am and 9:00:00 am. At 9:02:00 am,
it is calculated long average per 1hour between 8:01:00 am and 9:01:00
am.</p>
<p>TPS Increased by Percentage:</p>
<p>In <strong>TPS-based detection mode</strong>, if the ratio of the <strong>*transaction rate
detection interval **to the transaction rate history interval</strong> is
greater than the specific percentage you configure on this screen (i.e.
<strong>TPS increased by percentage</strong>), the system detects the URL to be under
attack, or the IP address to be attacking. In order to stop the attack,
the system blocks some, or all, requests from the detected IP address
and/to the attacked URL, depending on the configuration of the DoS
profile.</p>
<p>By using the function of “<strong>TPS increased by</strong>”, if the ASM system
has just processing the traffic in less than 1 min, BIG-IP ASM will not
detect any attack. In that case, the ASM system will depend on the
function</p>
<p>“<strong>TPS reached</strong>”
For <strong>IP Detection Criteria</strong>, modify the threshold values as needed.

<p><strong>Stress-based DoS protection</strong></p>
<p>Source -
<a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_asm/manuals/product/asm-implementations-12-0-0/2.html">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_asm/manuals/product/asm-implementations-12-0-0/2.html</a></p>
<p>When setting up DoS protection, you can configure the system to prevent
DoS attacks based on the server side (stress-based detection). In
stress-based detection, it takes a latency increase and at least one
suspicious IP address, URL, heavy URL, site-wide entry, or geolocation
for the activity to be considered an attack.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The average latency is measured for each site, that is, for
each virtual server and associated DoS profile. If one virtual server
has multiple DoS profiles (implemented using a local traffic policy),
then each DoS profile has its own statistics within the context of the
virtual server.</p>
<p>Stress-based protection is less prone to false positives than
TPS-based protection because in a DoS attack, the server is reaching
capacity and service/response time is slow: this is impacting all users.
Increased latency can be used as a trigger step for detecting an L7
attack. Following the detection of a significant latency increase, it is
important to determine whether you need further action. After examining
the increase in the requests per second and by comparing these numbers
with past activity, you can identify suspicious versus normal latency
increases.</p>
<p><strong>Detection Criteria</strong>, modify the threshold values as needed. If any of
these criteria is met, the system handles the attack according to the
Prevention Policy settings.</p>

<p>About DoS mitigation methods</p>
<p>When setting up either transaction-based or stress-based DoS protection,
you can specify mitigation methods that determine how the system
recognizes and handles DoS attacks. You can use the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript challenges</strong> (also called Client-Side Integrity Defense)</p>
<p>You can configure the system to issue a JavaScript challenge to analyze
whether the client is using a legal browser (that can respond to the
challenge) when the system encounters a suspicious IP address, URL,
geolocation, or site-wide criteria. If the client does execute
JavaScript in response to the challenge, the system purposely slows down
the interaction. The Client Side Integrity Defense mitigations are
enacted only when the Operation Mode is set to blocking.</p>
<p><strong>CAPTCHA challenges</strong></p>
<p>Based on the same suspicious criteria, the system can also issue a
CAPTCHA (character recognition) challenge to determine whether the
client is human or an illegal script. Depending on how strict you want
to enforce DoS protection, you can limit the number of requests that are
allowed through to the server or block requests that are deemed
suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>Request Blocking</strong></p>
<p>You can also use can use request blocking in the DoS profile to specify
conditions for when the system blocks requests. Note that the system
only blocks requests during a DoS attack when the Operation Mode for</p>
<p>TPS-based or stress-based detection is set to Blocking. You can use
request blocking to rate limit or block all requests from suspicious IP
addresses, suspicious countries, or URLs suspected of being under
attack.</p>
<p>Site-wide rate limiting also blocks requests to web sites suspected of
being under attack. If you block all requests, the system blocks
suspicious IP addresses and geolocations except those on the whitelist.
If you are using rate limiting, the system blocks some requests
depending on the threshold detection criteria set in the DoS profile.</p>
<p>The mitigation methods that you select are used in the order they appear
on the screen. The system enforces the methods only as needed if the
previous method was not able to stem the attack.</p>

<p>The defense configuration in an XML profile provides formatting and
attack pattern checks for the XML data. The defense configuration
complements the validation configuration to provide comprehensive
security for XML data and web services applications. If your XML
application has special requirements, you can adjust the defense
configuration settings.</p>
<p>The system checks requests that contain XML data to be sure that the
data complies with the various document limits defined in the defense
configuration of the security policy’s XML profile. The system generally
examines the message for compliance to boundaries such as the message’s
size, maximum depth, and maximum number of children. When the system
detects a problem in an XML document, it causes the XML data does not
comply with format settings violation, if the violation is set to Alarm
or Block.</p>
<p>The XML profile is updated if you changed which <strong>SOAP methods</strong> are
allowed by the security policy. If you disable a SOAP method, and a
request contains that method, the system issues the SOAP method not
allowed violation, and blocks the request if the enforcement mode is set
to blocking.</p>
<p>Detecting and Preventing Web Scraping</p>

<p><em>Web scraping</em> is a technique for extracting information from web sites
that often uses automated programs, or bots (short for web robots),
opening many sessions, or initiating many transactions. You can
configure</p>
<p>Application Security Manager (ASM) to detect and prevent various web
scraping activities on web sites that it is protecting.</p>
<p>ASM provides the following methods to address web scraping attacks.
These methods can work independently of each other, or they can work
together to detect and prevent web scraping attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Bot detection</strong> investigates whether a web client source is human
by limiting the number of page changes allowed within a specified
time.</p>
<p>You can mitigate web scraping on the web sites Application Security
Manager defends by attempting to determine whether a web client
source is human or a web robot. The bot detection method also
protects web applications against rapid surfing by measuring the
amount of time allowed to change a number of web pages before the
system suspects a bot.</p>
<p>The system checks for rapid surfing and if too many pages are
changed too quickly, it logs Web Scraping detected violations in the
event log, and specifies the attack type of bot detection.</p>
<p>After setting up bot detection, you can also set up fingerprinting,
session opening and session transactions anomaly detection for the
same security policy.</p>
<p><strong>Session opening</strong> detects an anomaly when either too many
sessions are opened from an IP address or when the number of sessions
exceeds a threshold from an IP address. Also, session opening can
detect an attack when the number of inconsistencies or session resets
exceeds the configured threshold within the defined time. This method
also identifies as an attack an open session that sends requests that
do not include an ASM cookie.</p>
<p>You can configure how the system protects your web application
against <em>session opening</em> web scraping violations that result from
too many sessions originating from a specific IP address,
inconsistencies detected in persistent storage, and when the number
of session resets exceeds the threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p>The Detection Criteria values all work together. The minimum
sessions value and one of the sessions opened values must be met for
traffic to be considered an attack. However, if the minimum sessions
value is not reached, traffic is never considered an attack even if
the Sessions opened per second increased by value is met.</p>
<p>The system checks for too many sessions being opened from one IP
address, too many cookie deletions, and persistent storage
inconsistencies depending on the options you selected. The system
logs violations in the web scraping event log along with information
about the attack including whether it is a Session Opening Anomaly
by IP Address or Session Resets by Persistent Client Identification</p>
<p>attack type and when it began and ended. The log also includes the type
of violation (Device Identification Integrity or Cookie Deletion
Detection) and the violation numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Session transactions anomaly</strong> captures sessions that request too
much traffic, compared to the average amount observed in the web
application. This is based on counting the transactions per session
and comparing that to the average amount observed in the web
application.</p>
<p>You can configure how the system protects your web application
against harvesting, which is detected by counting the number of
transactions per session and comparing that number to a total
average of transactions from all sessions. Harvesting may cause
session transaction anomalies.</p>
<p>When the system detects a session that requests too many
transactions (as compared to normal), all transactions from the
attacking session cause the Web Scraping detected violation to occur
until the end of attack or until the prevention duration expires.</p>
<p><strong>Fingerprinting</strong> captures information about browser attributes to
identify a client. It is used when the system fails to detect web
scraping anomalies by using IP addresses, ASM cookies, or persistent
device identification.</p>
<p>Fingerprinting is collecting browser attributes and saving the
information in a special POST data parameter. The system can use the
collected information to identify suspicious clients (potential
bots) and recognize web scraping attacks more quickly.</p>
<p>The system now collects browser attributes to help with web scraping
detection. If you also enabled the Suspicious Clients setting, when
the system detects clients that may be web scraping attempts using
information obtained by fingerprinting, the system records the
attack data, and blocks the suspicious requests.</p>
<p><strong>Suspicious clients</strong> used together with fingerprinting, specifies
how the system identifies and protects against potentially malicious
clients; for example, by detecting scraper extensions installed in a
browser.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system can accurately detect web scraping anomalies only
when response caching is turned off.</p>
<p>Prerequisites for configuring web scraping</p>
<p>For web scraping detection to work properly, you should understand
the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The web scraping mitigation feature requires that the DNS server is
on the DNS lookup server list.</li>
<li>Client browsers need to have <strong>JavaScript enabled</strong>, and support
cookies for anomaly detection to work.</li>
<li>Consider disabling response caching. If response caching is enabled,
the system does not protect cached content against web scraping.</li>
<li>The Application Security Manager does not perform web scraping
detection on legitimate search engine traffic. If your web
application has its own search engine, we recommend that you add it
to the system.</li>
<li>Web scraping attack types</li>
<li>Web scraping statistics specify the attack type so you have more
information about why the attack occurred. This shows the web
scraping attack types that can display in the web scraping event log.</li>

<p>Overview: Tracking user sessions using login pages</p>
<p>You can track user sessions using login pages configured from within
Application Security Manager (ASM), or have the policy retrieve the user
names from Access Policy Manager (APM). This implementation describes
how to set up session tracking for a security policy using login pages.
The advantage of using session tracking is that you can identify the
user, session, or IP address that instigated an attack.</p>
<p>Login pages, created manually or automatically, define the URLs,
parameters, and validation criteria required for users to log in to the
application. User and session information is included in the system logs
so you can track a session or user. The system can log activity, or
block a user or session if either generates too many violations.</p>
<p>If you configure session awareness, you can view the user and session
information in the application security charts.</p>

<p>To monitor user and session information, you first need to set up
session tracking for the security policy.</p>
<p>You can use the reporting tools in Application Security ManagerTM to
monitor user and session details, especially when you need to
investigate suspicious activity that is occurring with certain users,
sessions, or IP addresses.</p>
<p>The Session Tracking Status screen opens and shows the users, sessions,
and IP addresses that the system is currently tracking for this security
policy.</p>

<p>The difference between “<strong>block all</strong>” and “<strong>delay blocking</strong>”
is that with delay blocking you can defer blocking of a
session or an IP address because you want to tolerate a low volume of
violations, instead of immediately blocking any request that violates
the policy. In many cases there is a forensic reason for doing this, in
the event that you wish to observe the actions of a specific client. By
not tracking “user name” you will not be able to view user names or
login pages specifically, but ASM will still track HTTP session
information.</p>

access-12-0-0/2.html</p>
<p>Portal access enables end users to access internal web applications with
a web browser from outside the network. With portal access, the BIG-IP®
Access Policy Manager® communicates with back-end servers, and rewrites
links in web application pages so that further requests from the client
browser are directed back to the Access Policy Manager server. With
portal access, the client computer requires no specialized client
software other than a web browser.</p>
<p>Portal access provides clients with secure access to internal web
servers, such as Microsoft® Outlook®Web Access (OWA), Microsoft
SharePoint®, and IBM® Domino® Web Access. Using portal access
functionality, you can also provide access to most web-based
applications and internal web servers.</p>
<p>Portal access differs from network access, which provides direct access
from the client to the internal network. Network access does not
manipulate or analyze the content being passed between the client and
the internal network. The portal access configuration gives the
administrator both refined control over the applications that a user can
access through Access Policy Manager, and content inspection for the
application data. The other advantage of portal access is security. Even
if a workstation might not meet requirements for security for full
network access, such a workstation can be passed by the access policy to
certain required web applications, without allowing full network access.
In a portal access policy, the client computer itself never communicates
directly with the end-point application. That means that all
communication is inspected at a very high level, and any attacks
originating on the client computer fail because the attack cannot
navigate through the links that have been rewritten by the portal access
engine.</p>
<p>Portal access configuration elements</p>
<p>A portal access configuration requires:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A portal access resource including one or more portal access resource
items</li>
<li>An access profile</li>
<li>An access policy that assigns:</li>

<p><em>Understanding portal access patching</em></p>
<p>Portal access <em>patches</em>, or rewrites, links in web content. Portal
access rewrites links in complex JavaScriptTM, Flash®, CSS, and HTML. In
full patching mode, Access Policy Manager® retrieves content from
back-end servers and rewrites links in that content so it can be
presented to a web browser, as if the content originated from the Access
Policy Manager. Portal access rewrites content to make intranet targets
resolvable, no matter what the intranet host is.</p>

</div>
<p>SAML can be useful to access multiple services using “assertion” (as an
authenticated token) for authentication, rather than traditional
username and password. SAML can be implemented for on-premises as well
as off-premises (SaaS) or applications hosted in cloud.</p>
<p>In general analogy, assertion means validating your identity with
authentic fact or belief. For example, at many places you require to
present your national ID / Passport etc to access to certain places /
services. In Digital world, precisely in SAML, assertion means the same.
Presenting valid assertion is mandatory before Service Provider grants
the access to the hosted services.</p>
<p>SAML consist of 3 different components as following. • User</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identity Provider (IdP)</li>
<li>Service Provider (SP)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User</strong> – The entity which access the services.</p>
<p><strong>IdP</strong> – The entity which authenticates and assigns the “assertion”
post successful authentication and passes the assertion (token) to
SP (Service Provider) to grant the user access (if require) based on
the “Access Control” associated with the user privileges.</p>
<p>IdP then keeps the authenticated session for further use in the
memory.</p>
<p><strong>SP</strong> - The entity which hosts the services. Such as Office 365 /
Salesforce / WebEx etc.</p>

<p>A Secure Web Gateway (SWG) explicit forward proxy deployment provides an
easy way to handle web requests from users. For explicit forward proxy,
you configure client browsers to point to a forward proxy server. A
forward proxy server establishes a tunnel for SSL traffic. Other virtual
servers (wildcard SSL and wildcard forwarding IP virtual servers) listen
on the tunnel. The listener that best matches the web traffic directed
to the forward proxy server handles the traffic.</p>

<p>BIG-IP® Access Policy Manager® Secure Web Gateway (SWG) implements a
secure web gateway by adding access control, based on URL
categorization, <strong>to forward proxy</strong>. The access profile supports both
transparent and explicit forward proxy modes. The access policy includes
support for using a captive portal to collect credentials for
transparent forward proxy mode and <strong>HTTP 407-based</strong> credential capture
for explicit forward proxy mode. In addition to user identification by
credentials, SWG provides the option to identify users transparently,
providing access based on best effort identification. SWG also supports
SSL traffic inspection.</p>
<p>The benefits that SWG provides include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>URL filtering capability for outbound web traffic.</li>
<li>Identifying malicious content and providing the means to block it.</li>
<li>Applying web application controls for application types, such as
social networking and Internet communication in corporate
environments.</li>
<li>Monitoring and gating outbound traffic to maximize productivity and
meet business needs.</li>
<li>User identification or authentication (or both) tied to monitoring,

<p>F5® BIG-IQ® Centralized Management is an intelligent framework for
managing F5 security and application delivery solutions. BIG-IQ
Centralized Management provides a central point of control for F5
physical and virtual devices as well as for the following BIG-IP
software modules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BIG-IP® Local Traffic ManagerTM (LTM)</li>
<li>BIG-IP® Application Security ManagerTM (ASM)</li>
<li>BIG-IP® Advanced Firewall ManagerTM (AFM)</li>
<li>BIG-IP® Access Policy Manager® (APM)</li>
<li>F5 WebSafeTM and F5 MobileSafe® (monitoring only)</li>
</ul>
<p>F5 BIG-IQ Centralized Management is ideal for organizations that
require central management of F5 devices and modules, license
management of BIG-IP virtual editions (VEs), or central reporting
and alerting on application availability, performance, and security.
BIG-IQ Centralized Management employs role-based access control
(RBAC), empowering application and security teams to manage their
own applications while helping to maintain consistent policies and
procedures across the enterprise.</p>
<p>Central logging, reporting, and auditing</p>
<p>BIG-IQ Centralized Management is a single solution for logging,
reporting on, and auditing your F5 devices. Using BIG-IQ Centralized
Management to log BIG-IP APM, WebSafe, or BIG-IP ASM events requires
a BIG-IQ Logging Node. Speak to your F5 sales representative for
details.</p>
<p>Functions for device management</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Centralized software upgrades—Centrally manage BIG-IP upgrades (from
TMOS versions 10.2.0 and above) by uploading TMOS releases into
BIG-IQ Centralized Management and directing the upgrade process for
managed BIG-IP devices from one place. The BIG-IQ Centralized
Management upgrade wizard guides you through the process and guards
against common upgrade errors.</li>
<li>License management—Centrally manage BIG-IP VE licenses, granting and
revoking licenses as business needs change. Gain the flexibility to
license devices only as needed, maximizing the return on your BIG-IP
investment. Assign different license pools to different applications
or tenants for more flexible provisioning.</li>
<li>Utility license usage reporting—Enable utility licensing of BIG-IP
devices by generating and delivering reports of device use over time.</li>
<li>Device discovery and monitoring—Discover, track, and monitor all
BIG-IP devices—whether physical or virtual—including key metrics such
as CPU/memory and disk usage and high availability status. The
cluster view shows trust domains, sync groups, and failover groups.</li>
<li>Configuration, backup, and restore—Use BIG-IQ Centralized Management
as a central repository of BIG-IP configuration files (UCS), and
backup and restore system information on demand or as a scheduled
process.</li>
<li>BIG-IP device cluster support—Monitor high availability (HA) and
clusters for BIG-IP devices.</li>
<li>SSL monitoring—Track and receive alerts on the status of SSL
certificates.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Reporting suspected vulnerabilities</em></p>
<p>F5 welcomes any reports of suspected vulnerabilities or other security
concerns with our products.</p>
<p>If you are an F5 customer with an active support contract, please
contact F5 Technical Support via our customer portal, or by phone.</p>
<p>If you are not an F5 customer, please send an email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:f5sirt&#37;&#52;&#48;f5&#46;com">f5sirt<span>&#64;</span>f5<span>&#46;</span>com</a>.
You will be contacted by an engineer who will provide you with various
options for secure communication, and work with you to gather the
necessary details to determine an appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>In cases where responsible disclosure is followed, and at the reporter’s
request, F5 will provide attribution to reporters within a public AskF5
article.</p>
<p><em>Vulnerability categories</em></p>
<p>F5 investigates and prioritizes reports based on the potential
exploitability of the vulnerability. F5 divides security vulnerabilities
into the six categories listed in the following table. For software
releases that are within their standard support phase, F5 provides the
resolutions listed in the <strong>Action</strong> column whenever technically
feasible. In rare cases, when F5 cannot provide the listed resolution on
a specific version due to technical limitations, customers may need to
upgrade to a different software version to receive the fix.</p>
