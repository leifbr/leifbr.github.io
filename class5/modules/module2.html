<p><strong>LTM Management</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP can be managed through either the TMM switch interfaces or
the MGMT interface. However, F5 recommends that you use the management
port.</p>
<p>The TMM switch ports are the interfaces that the BIG-IP system uses to
send and receive load-balanced traffic.</p>
<p>The system uses the MGMT interface to perform system management
functions. The MGMT interface is intended for administrative traffic and
cannot be used for load-balanced traffic. Additionally, since no access
controls can be applied on the MGMT interface, F5 recommends that you
limit network access through the MGMT interface to trusted traffic. For
security reasons, the MGMT interface should be connected to only a
secure, management-only network, such as one that uses an RFC1918
private IP address space. If you do not have a trusted and secure
management network, F5 recommends that you do not use the MGMT
interface, and that you grant administrative access through the TMM
switch interfaces or the local serial console.</p>
<p>Note: In BIG-IP versions earlier than 11.2.0, you must assign an IPv4
address to the management port. Beginning in BIG-IP 11.2.0, you can
assign either an IPv4 or IPv6 to the management port.</p>

<p><strong>Serial Console Connection</strong></p>
<p>In the event that network access is impaired or not yet configured, the
serial console might be the only way to access your BIG-IP® system.</p>
<p>Important: You should perform all BIG-IP software installations and
upgrades using the serial console, as these procedures require reboots,
in which network connectivity is lost temporarily.</p>
<p>Note: If you cannot see or read output on the serial console, make sure
that the baud rate is set to 19200.</p>

<p><strong>2.01 - Explain the differences between the flow of management and application traffic</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7312">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7312</a></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system uses the following two network connection entry
points:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) switch interfaces</li>
<li>Management interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Either the TMM switch interfaces or the management interface can provide
administrative access to the BIG-IP system. However, F5 recommends that
you use the management interface.</p>
<p>The TMM switch ports are the interfaces that the BIG-IP system uses to
send and receive load-balanced traffic.</p>
<p>The system uses the management interface to perform system management
functions. The management interface is intended for administrative
traffic and cannot be used for load-balanced traffic. Additionally,
since there are limited access controls that can be applied to the
management interface, F5 recommends that you limit network access
through the management interface to trusted traffic. For security
reasons, the management interface should only be connected to a secure,
management-only network, such as one that uses an RFC1918 private IP
address space. If you do not have a trusted and secure management

<p><strong>2.01 - Explain how to configure management connectivity options: AOM, serial console, USB &amp; Management Ethernet Port</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13117?sr=42528406">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13117?sr=42528406</a></p>
<p><strong>USB</strong></p>
<p>On rare occasions, you may be required to perform a clean installation
of BIG-IP 11.x. During a clean installation, all mass-storage devices
are wiped, therefore restoring the BIG-IP system to its factory
defaults. In addition, a clean installation allows you to reinstall a
BIG-IP unit that no longer boots from any of its boot locations.</p>
<p>You should choose an installation method based on the equipment
available to you, and whether you have physical access to the system
that requires reinstalling. Choose one of the following installation
methods, which are listed in order of preference:</p>
<p>USB DVD-ROM drive</p>
<p>Note: F5 recommends that you perform a clean installation by using a
USB DVD-ROM drive, as this is the simplest and most reliable of all
the installation methods.</p>
<p>USB thumb drive</p>
<p>Burn the product ISO image to a DVD.</p>
<p>Image the USB thumb drive using the product ISO image file.</p>
<p><strong>Installing the software</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Connect to the BIG-IP system serial console.</li>
<li>Depending on the choice you made in the previous procedure, perform one of the following actions:<ul>
<li>Connect the USB DVD-ROM drive to the F5 system and load the disc you burned with the product ISO image.</li>
<li>Connect the USB thumb drive to the F5 system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reboot the BIG-IP system. If the F5 system cannot reboot, power cycle the BIG-IP system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Upon completion of this step, regardless of the installation
method, the BIG-IP system boots into the Maintenance Operating
System (MOS).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>The MOS asks you to specify the type of terminal you are using. If you do not know what to specify, press Enter. The default setting (vt100) is fine in most cases.</li>
<li>If you have booted the F5 system from a USB device, the system may display a manufacturing installation dialog.</li>
<li>Press Ctrl+C to exit the dialog.</li>
<li>Continue with step 8 if you have booted the F5 system from a USB removable media containing a BIG-IP 11.0.0 image, but you want to perform a custom installation using the diskinit and image2disk utilities. Otherwise, to reinstall the system according to the manufacturing installation plan displayed in the output, press Enter and skip to step 10.</li>
</ol>
<p>7. To wipe all mass-storage devices inside the BIG-IP system, type the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">diskinit</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">style</span> <span class="n">volumes</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Important: Do not omit the –style option; if you omit it, the
system wipes the drives but does not reformat them.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li>The diskinit utility asks whether you want to proceed wiping the drives. To continue, type y and press Enter. Otherwise, type n and press Enter.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Important</em>: Confirming this operation destroys all data on the
system. Do not proceed with this step if you have data that needs to
be recovered from the system. Using the MOS, you may be able to
manually mount a partition or volume and recover such data.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="9">
<li>Install the software using one of the following methods:</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using a USB DVD-ROM drive or a USB thumb drive, use the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">image2disk</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nb">format</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">volumes</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">nosaveconfig</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">nosavelicense</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you are using a PXE server, use the following command syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">image2disk</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nb">format</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">volumes</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">nosaveconfig</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">nosavelicense</span>
<span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//&lt;</span><span class="n">SERVER_IP</span><span class="o">&gt;/&lt;</span><span class="n">PATH</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For example, to install BIG-IP 11.x on HD1.1 using the http server
configured in the previous procedure, type the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">image2disk</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nb">format</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">volumes</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">nosaveconfig</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">nosavelicense</span>
<span class="n">http</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="mf">192.168</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mf">1.1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">SOL13117</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note: BIG-IP 11.x cannot be installed on a CompactFlash media drive;
you must use boot locations on the system’s hard drive.</p>
<p>Note: You must specify the –nosaveconfig option, as the system does
not have a configuration to save.</p>
<p>Note: If you are using a USB DVD-ROM drive or a USB thumb drive, you
do not need to specify an installation repository, as the image2disk
utility automatically finds and defaults to /cdserver.</p>
<p>Note: For more information about the image2disk utility, refer to
the Help screen by using the image2disk –h command.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="10">
<li>Once the installation has completed, disconnect any removable media from the BIG-IP system.</li>
</ol>
<p>11. To restart the system, type the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">reboot</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The system boots from the location you have just reinstalled.</p>

<p><strong>Serial Console</strong></p>
<p>You can administer a BIG-IP system by using a null modem cable to
connect a management system that runs a terminal emulator program to the
BIG-IP serial port. To connect to the BIG-IP system using the serial
port, you must have a DB9 null modem cable and a VT100-capable terminal
emulator available on the management system.</p>
<p>To configure a serial terminal console for the BIG-IP system, perform
the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Connect the null modem cable to the console port on the BIG-IP system.</li>
<li>Connect the null modem cable to a serial port on the management system with the terminal emulator.</li>
<li>Configure the serial terminal emulator settings according to the following table:</li>

<p><strong>AOM</strong></p>
<p>Always-On Management (AOM) is a separate subsystem that provides
lights-out management for the BIG-IP system by using the 10/100/1000
Ethernet management port over secure shell (SSH), or by using the serial
console.</p>
<p>AOM allows you to manage BIG-IP platforms using SSH (most platforms) or
the serial console, even if the Host subsystem is turned off. The BIG-IP
Host subsystem and the AOM subsystem operate independently. If AOM is
reset or fails, the BIG-IP Host subsystem continues to operate and there
is no interruption to load-balanced traffic. AOM is always turned on
when power is supplied to the platform. If the BIG-IP Host subsystem
stops responding, you can use the AOM Command Menu to reset it.</p>
<p><strong>Configuring AOM network access</strong></p>
<p>To configure AOM so that it can be accessed over the network, perform
the following procedure:</p>

<p><strong>2.02 - Explain the requirements for self IPs (including port lockdown)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-concepts-11-5-0/13.html">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-concepts-11-5-0/13.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Self IPs</strong></p>
<p>It is when you initially run the Setup utility on a BIG-IP system that
you normally create any static and floating self IP addresses and assign
them to VLANs. However, if you want to create additional self IP
addresses later, you can do so using the Configuration utility.</p>
<p>Note: Only users with either the Administrator or Resource
Administrator user role can create and manage self IP addresses.</p>
<p>Note: A self IP address can be in either IPv4 or IPv6 format.</p>
<p><strong>IP address</strong></p>
<p>A self IP address, combined with a netmask, typically represents a range
of host IP addresses in a VLAN. If you are assigning a self IP address
to a VLAN group, the self IP address represents the range of self IP
addresses assigned to the VLANs in that group.</p>
<p><strong>Netmask</strong></p>
<p>When you specify a netmask for a self IP address, the self IP address
can represent a range of IP addresses, rather than a single host
address. For example, a self IP address of 10.0.0.100 can represent
several host IP addresses if you specify a netmask of 255.255.0.0.</p>
<p><strong>VLAN/Tunnel assignment</strong></p>
<p>You assign a unique self IP address to a specific VLAN or a VLAN group:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Assigning a self IP address to a VLAN</li>
</ul>
<p>The self IP address that you assign to a VLAN should represent an
address space that includes the self IP addresses of the hosts that
the VLAN contains. For example, if the address of one destination
server in a VLAN is 10.0.0.1 and the address of another server in
the VLAN is 10.0.0.2, you could assign a self IP address of
10.0.0.100, with a netmask of 255.255.0.0, to the VLAN.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Assigning a self IP address to a VLAN group</li>
</ul>
<p>The self IP address that you assign to a VLAN group should represent
an address space that includes the self IP addresses of the VLANs
that you assigned to the group. For example, if the self IP address
of one VLAN in a VLAN group is 10.0.20.100 and the address of the
other VLAN in a VLAN group is 10.0.30.100,you could assign an
address of 10.0.0.100, with a netmask of 255.255.0.0, to the VLAN
group.</p>
<p>The VLAN/Tunnel list in the BIG-IP Configuration utility displays the
names of all existing VLANs and VLAN groups.</p>
<p><strong>Port lockdown</strong></p>
<p>Each self IP address has a feature known as port lockdown. Port lockdown
is a security feature that allows you to specify particular UDP and TCP
protocols and services from which the self IP address can accept
traffic. By default, a self IP address accepts traffic from these
protocols and services:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For UDP, the allowed protocols and services are: DNS (53), SNMP
(161), RIP (520)</li>
<li>For TCP, the allowed protocols and services are: SSH (22), DNS (53),
SNMP (161), HTTPS (443), 4353 (iQuery)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to use the default setting (Allow Default), you can
configure port lockdown to allow either all UDP and TCP protocols and
services (Allow All), no UDP protocols and services (Allow None), or
only those that you specify (Allow Custom).</p>
<p><strong>Traffic groups</strong></p>
<p>If you want the self IP address to be a floating IP address, that is, an
address shared between two or more BIG-IP devices in a device group, you
can assign a floating traffic group to the self IP address. A floating
traffic group causes the self IP address to become a floating self IP
address.</p>
<p>A floating self IP address ensures that application traffic reaches its
destination. More specifically, a floating self IP address enables a
source node to successfully send a request, and a destination node to
successfully send a response, when the relevant BIG-IP device is
unavailable.</p>
<p>If you want the self IP address to be a static (non-floating) IP address
(used mostly for standalone devices), you can assign a non-floating
traffic group to the self IP address. A non-floating traffic group
causes the self IP address to become a non-floating self IP address. An
example of a non-floating self IP address is the address that you assign
to the default VLAN named HA, which is used strictly to process failover
communications between BIG-IP devices, instead of processing application
traffic.</p>

<p><strong>2.02 - Explain routing requirements for management and application traffic (including route domains and IPv6)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13284?sr=42499558">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13284?sr=42499558</a></p>
<p>The Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) controls all of the BIG-IP
switch ports (TMM interfaces), and the underlying Linux operating system
controls the BIG-IP management interface. The management interface
processes only administrative traffic. The TMM interfaces process both
application traffic and administrative traffic.</p>
<p>Inbound administrative traffic</p>
<p>The Linux operation system processes inbound traffic sent to the BIG-IP
management IP address and arriving on the management interface. Inbound
connections sent to the BIG-IP self IP addresses that arrive on a TMM
interface are processed by TMM. If the self IP address is configured to
allow a connection to the destination service port, TMM hands the
connection off to the Linux operating system, which then processes the
connection request. By default, the BIG-IP system uses Auto Last Hop to
return response traffic to a remote host. Auto Last Hop returns response
traffic to the MAC address of the device from which the traffic last
traversed before reaching the BIG-IP system.</p>
<p>Note: Beginning in BIG-IP 14.1.0, the Auto Last Hop feature is no longer
available on the BIG-IP management interface. For more information,
refer to K55225090: BIG-IP VE no longer supports Auto Last Hop for
management connections.</p>
<p>Outbound administrative traffic</p>
<p>The Linux operating system processes outbound traffic sent from the
BIG-IP system by administrative applications, such as SNMP, SMTP, SSH,
and NTP. These connections may use either the management address or a
self IP address as the source address. The BIG-IP system compares the
destination address to the routing table to determine the interface
through which the BIG-IP system routes the traffic.</p>
<p>BIG-IP routing tables</p>
<p>The BIG-IP routing table consists of a combination of routing subtables.
A subtable for management routes, and a subtable for TMM routes. Routes
in the TMM subtable are defined with a lower metric than routes in the
management subtable. As a result, if an equally specific route exists as
both a TMM route and a management route, the system will prefer the TMM
route. This also applies if the only defined management route is a
default gateway, the system will prefer the TMM default gateway.</p>
<p>TMM switch routes are routes that the BIG-IP system uses to forward
traffic through the TMM switch interfaces instead of through the
management interface. Traffic sourced from a TMM (self IP) address will
always use the most specific matching TMM route. Traffic sourced from a
TMM address will never use a management route. When TMM is not running,
the TMM addresses are not available, and all TMM routes are removed. As
a result, when TMM is not running, all outbound administrative traffic
uses the most specific matching management route.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system uses management routes to forward traffic through the
management interface.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K84417414">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K84417414</a></p>
<p><strong>Route domains</strong></p>
<p>Route domains are designed to overcome the problem of overlapping
network IP address spaces. Because of this design, forwarding traffic
between route domains is limited.</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>One intended route domain implementation would be when the BIG-IP system
hosts multiple tenants that use the same private IP address space to
configure their networking devices. In this case, route domains allow
the hosting BIG-IP system to use the same IP address space for multiple
tenants, while preventing direct access between the tenants.</p>
<p>You can allow access between route domains in a limited capacity by
using parent-child relationships and strict isolation.</p>
<p>Parent-child relationship</p>
<p>When you create a route domain, you can associate a parent route domain.
When the BIG-IP system is unable to find a necessary route in the child
domain, the system can then search an associated parent route domain for
a possible route. The default associated route domain is None.</p>
<p>Strict isolation</p>
<p>When enabled, strict isolation specifies whether the system enforces
cross-routing restrictions. When enabled, routes cannot cross-route
domain boundaries; they are strictly isolated to the current route
domain. The default setting is Enabled. When disabled, a route can
cross-route domains. For example, you can add a route to the routing
table where the destination is 10.0.0.0%20 (route domain 20) and the
gateway is 172.27.84.29%32 (route domain 32).</p>
<p>Note: When strict isolation is enabled on a route domain, the BIG-IP
system allows traffic forwarding from that route domain to the specified
parent route domain only. To enforce strict isolation between
parent-child route domains, you must enable the strict isolation feature
on both the child and the parent route domains.</p>
<p>VLANs</p>
<p>Route domains may not be the proper choice if the intended use does not
involve overlapping IP address spaces. Virtual Local Area Networks
(VLAN) serve as a logical separation of hosts using the same IP address
space. Unlike route domains, the BIG-IP system can forward traffic
between VLANs with simple modifications to the routing table.</p>

<p><strong>IPV6</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP is a native IPV6 device.</p>
<p>In BIG-IP versions prior to 11.0.0, there is no option in the
Configuration utility to specify an IPv6 default route. The default
configuration when creating network routes on the BIG-IP system is for
IPv4. To specify a default route for an IPv6 address, you must specify
both a destination network that uses the route, and a netmask value.
Otherwise, the route will be added to the BIG-IP system configuration as
an IPv4 default route pointing to an IPv6 gateway.</p>
<p>To specify an IPv6 default route on the BIG-IP system using the
Configuration utility, perform the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to the Configuration utility.</li>
<li>Navigate to Network &gt; Routes.</li>
<li>Click Add.</li>
<li>From the Type menu, click Route.</li>
<li>Specify :: as the Destination.</li>
<li>Specify :: as the Netmask.</li>
<li>From the Resource list, click Use Gateway.</li>
<li>In the box, type the IPv6 IP address.</li>
<li>Click Finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>To specify an IPv6 default route on the BIG-IP system using the Traffic
Management Shell (tmsh), perform the following procedure:</p>
<p>1. Log in to the tmsh utility by typing the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">tmsh</span>

is all based on system time. SSL certificates could have issues with the
expiration dates. In HA environments if the system time is not set
correctly between the units in the HA configuration the systems may not
be able to sync configs.</p>
<p>When the BIG-IP system clock is not showing the correct timezone, or the
date and time is not synchronized correctly, this could be caused by
incorrect NTP configuration or a communication issue with a valid NTP
peer server. Remember that even if you have the NTP settings correct in
the BIG-IP system it may not be able to reach the NTP if there is an
up-stream Firewall or other network restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Network Time Protocol (NTP)</strong></p>
<p>NTP is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over
the network. On BIG-IP systems, accurate timestamps are essential to
guarantee the correct behavior of a number of features. While in most
cases it is sufficient to configure a couple of time servers that the
BIG-IP system will use to update its system time, it is also possible to
define more advanced NTP configurations on the BIG-IP system.</p>

<p><strong>Remote authentication and authorization of BIG-IP user accounts</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system includes a comprehensive solution for managing BIG-IP
administrative accounts on your network. With this solution, you can:</p>
<p><strong>Use a remote server to store BIG-IP system user accounts.</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system includes support for using a remote authentication
server to store BIG-IP system user accounts. After creating BIG-IP
system accounts on the remote server (using the server vendor’s
instructions), you can configure the BIG-IP system to use remote user
authentication and authorization (access control) for that server type.</p>
<p><strong>Assign group-based access.</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system includes an optional feature known as remote role
groups. With the remote role groups feature, you can use existing group
definitions on the remote server to define the access control properties
for users in a group. This feature not only provides more granularity in
assigning user privileges, but also removes any need to duplicate remote
user accounts on the BIG-IP system for the purpose of assigning those
privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Propagate a set of authorization data to multiple BIG-IP systems.</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system includes a tool for propagating BIG-IP system
configuration data to multiple BIG-IP devices on the network. This tool
is known as the Single Configuration File (SCF) feature.</p>

<p><strong>Administrative partitions</strong></p>
<p>When you create configurable objects for the BIG-IP system, you have the
option of putting those objects into administrative partitions. An
administrative partition is a logical container of BIG-IP system objects
such as virtual servers, pools, and monitors. When you first install the
BIG-IP system, a default partition already exists named Common.</p>
<p>By putting objects into partitions, you establish a finer granularity of
access control. Rather than having control over all resources on the
BIG-IP system or no resources whatsoever, users with certain permissions
can control resources within a designated partition only. For example,
users with the role of Operator can mark nodes up or down, but can only
mark those nodes that reside within their designated partition.</p>
<p>User accounts are another type of object that you can put into a
partition. You put user accounts into administrative partitions strictly
for the purpose of giving other users administrative access to those
accounts. For example, you can put user accounts into partition B, and
then assign a set of permissions (known as a user role) to user Jane so
that she is allowed to modify user accounts in partition B.</p>
<p>Each user account on the BIG-IP system has a property known as Partition
Access. The Partition Access property defines the partitions that the
user can access. A user account can have access to either one partition
or all partitions. Access to all partitions is known as universal
access.</p>
<p>This figure shows how partition access can differ for different user
accounts on the BIG-IP system.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p82.png" src="../../_images/p82.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>In this example, the BIG-IP system objects reside in multiple
partitions. Note that user accounts are also a type of BIG-IP system
object, and as such, reside in a partition named Users. (Although you
are not required to group user accounts together in a separate
partition, for security purposes F5 highly recommends that you
do so.)</p>
<p>To continue with the example, each user account in partition Users has
access to specific, but different, partitions. Note that user accounts
sjones, cjohnson, and gnelson can access one partition only, while the
tbrown account has universal access.</p>
<p>To summarize, an administrative partition defines a set of objects,
including user accounts, that other administrative users can potentially
manage. This gives computing organizations greater control over user
access to specific objects on the BIG-IP system.</p>
<p><strong>Effect of user roles on objects within partitions</strong></p>
<p>A user role defines the access level that a user has for each object in
the user’s assigned partition. An access level refers to the type of
task that a user can perform on an object. Possible access levels are:</p>
<p><strong>Write</strong></p>
<p>Grants full access: that is, the ability to create, modify, enable and
disable, and delete an object.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Grants the ability to modify, enable, and disable an object.</p>
<p><strong>Enable/disable</strong></p>
<p>Grants the ability to enable or disable an object.</p>

<p><strong>2.05 - Explain how the score is calculated for HA groups</strong></p>

<p><strong>Specifying the HA capacity of a device</strong></p>
<p>Before you perform this task, verify that this device is a member of a
device group and that the device group contains three or more devices.</p>
<p>You perform this task when you have more than one type of hardware
platform in a device group and you want to configure load-aware
failover. Load-aware failover ensures that the BIG-IP system can
intelligently select the next-active device for each active traffic
group in the device group when failover occurs. As part of configuring
load-aware failover, you define an HA capacity to establish the amount
of computing resource that the device provides relative to other devices
in the device group.</p>
<p>Note: If all devices in the device group are the same hardware platform,
you can skip this task.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click Device Management &gt; Devices. This displays a list of device objects discovered by the local device.</li>
<li>In the Name column, click the name of the device for which you want to view properties. This displays a table of properties for the device.</li>
<li>In the HA Capacity field, type a relative numeric value. You need to configure this setting only when you have varying types of hardware platforms in a device group and you want to configure load-aware failover. The value you specify represents the relative capacity of the device to process application traffic compared to the other devices in the device group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Important: If you configure this setting, you must configure the
setting on every device in the device group.</p>
<p>If this device has half the capacity of a second device and a third
of the capacity of a third device in the device group, you can
specify a value of 100 for this device, 200 for the second device,
and 300 for the third device. When choosing the next active device
for a traffic group, the system considers the capacity that you
specified for this device.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Click Update.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you perform this task, the BIG-IP system uses the HA Capacity
value to calculate the current utilization of the local device, to
determine the next-active device for failover of other traffic groups in
the device group.</p>
<p><strong>Specifying an HA load factor for a traffic group</strong></p>
<p>You perform this task when you want to specify the relative application
load for an existing traffic group, for the purpose of configuring
load-aware failover. Load-aware failover ensures that the BIG-IP system
can intelligently select the next-active device for each active traffic
group in the device group when failover occurs. When you configure
load-aware failover, you define an application traffic load (known as an
HA load factor) for a traffic group to establish the amount of computing
resource that an active traffic group uses relative to other active
traffic groups.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click Device Management &gt; Traffic Groups.</li>
<li>In the Name column, click the name of a traffic group. This displays the properties of the traffic group.</li>
<li>From the Failover Methods list, select Load Aware. This displays the HA Load Factor setting.</li>
<li>In the HA Load Factor field, specify a value that represents the application load for this traffic group relative to other active traffic groups on the local device.</li>
</ol>
<p>Important: If you configure this setting, you must configure the
setting on every traffic group in the device group.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Click Update.</li>
</ol>
<p>After performing this task, the BIG-IP system uses the HA Load Factor
value as a factor in calculating the current utilization of the local
device, to determine whether this device should be the next-active
device for failover of other traffic groups in the device group.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Results</strong></p>
<p>For this implementation example, the load-aware configuration now
consists of both a user-specified relative high availability (HA)
hardware capacity for each device and a relative load factor for each
active traffic group.</p>
<p>Using the example in the overview, devices Bigip_A and Bigip_B are the
same hardware platform and therefore have the same HA capacity, while
Bigip_C has twice the HA capacity of the other two devices. Also,
devices Bigip_A and Bigip_B currently have one active traffic group
each, while Bigip_C has two active traffic groups. All three traffic
groups process the same amount of application traffic.</p>

<p>Device utilization scores based on device capacity and traffic group
load</p>
<p>The device utilization score that the BIG-IP system calculates in this
implementation is the sum of all traffic load values on a device divided

<p>This example shows the results of the calculations that the BIG-IP
system performs for each device in the device group. The example shows
that although device Bigip_C currently has the two active traffic
groups, the device has the most available resource due to having the
lowest utilization score of .15. In this case, Bigip_C is most likely
the next-active device for the other two devices in the device group.</p>

<p><strong>Establishing device trust</strong></p>
<p>Before you begin this task, verify that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each BIG-IP device that is to be part of the local trust domain has a device certificate installed on it.</li>
<li>The local device is designated as a certificate signing authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>You perform this task to establish trust among devices on one or more
network segments. Devices that trust each other constitute the local
trust domain. A device must be a member of the local trust domain prior
to joining a device group.</p>
<p>By default, the BIG-IP software includes a local trust domain with one
member, which is the local device. You can choose any one of the BIG-IP
devices slated for a device group and log into that device to add other
devices to the local trust domain. For example, devices A, B, and C each
initially shows only itself as a member of the local trust domain. To
configure the local trust domain to include all three devices, you can
simply log into device A and add devices B and C to the local trust
domain. Note that there is no need to repeat this process on devices B
and C.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click Device Management &gt; Device Trust, and then either Peer List or Subordinate List.</li>
<li>Click Add.</li>
<li>Type a device IP address, administrator user name, and administrator password for the remote BIG-IP device with which you want to establish trust. The IP address you specify depends on the type of BIG-IP device:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the BIG-IP device is a non-VIPRION device, type the management IP address for the device.</li>
<li>If the BIG-IP device is a VIPRION device that is not licensed and provisioned for vCMP, type the primary cluster management IP address for the cluster.</li>
<li>If the BIG-IP device is a VIPRION device that is licensed and provisioned for vCMP, type the cluster management IP address for the guest.</li>
<li>If the BIG-IP device is an Amazon Web Services EC2 device, type one of the Private IP addresses created for this EC2 instance.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Click Retrieve Device Information.</li>
<li>Verify that the certificate of the remote device is correct.</li>
<li>Verify that the name of the remote device is correct.</li>
<li>Verify that the management IP address and name of the remote device are correct.</li>
<li>Click Finished.</li>

<p>traffic_group_1 is active on a device in a Sync-Failover device group</p>
<img alt="../../_images/p111.png" src="../../_images/p111.png" />
<p>On failover, traffic_group_1 becomes active on another device in the
Sync-Failover device group</p>
<p>A device in the trust domain can be a member of both a Sync-Failover
group and a Sync-Only group simultaneously.</p>
<p>For devices in a Sync-Failover group, the BIG-IP system uses both the
device group and the traffic group attributes of a folder to make
decisions about which devices to target for synchronizing the contents
of the folder, and which application-related configuration objects to
include in failover.</p>
<p>You can control the way that the BIG-IP chooses a target failover
device. This control is especially useful when a device group contains
heterogeneous hardware platforms that differ in load capacity, because
you can ensure that when failover occurs, the system will choose the
device with the most available resource to process the application
traffic.</p>

<p>Sample Sync-Failover device groups in a trust domain</p>
<p><strong>Sample Sync-Failover configuration</strong></p>
<p>You can use a Sync-Failover device group in a variety of ways. This
sample configuration shows two separate Sync-Failover device groups in
the local trust domain. Device group A is a standard active-standby
configuration. Prior to failover, only BIGIP1 processes traffic for
application A. This means that BIGIP1 and BIGIP2 synchronize their
configurations, and BIGIP1 fails over to BIGIP2 if BIGIP1 becomes
unavailable. BIGIP1 cannot fail over to BIGIP3 or BIGIP4 because those
devices are in a separate device group.</p>
<p>Device group B is also a standard active-standby configuration, in which
BIGIP3 normally processes traffic for application B. This means that
BIGIP3 and BIGIP4 synchronize their configurations, and BIGIP3 fails
over to BIGIP4 if BIGIP3 becomes unavailable. BIGIP3 cannot fail over to
BIGIP1 or BIGIP2 because those devices are in a separate device group.</p>
<p><strong>Sync-Failover device group considerations</strong></p>
<p>The following configuration restrictions apply to Sync-Failover device
groups:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A specific BIG-IP device in a trust domain can belong to one
Sync-Failover device group only.</li>
<li>On each device in a Sync-Failover device group, the BIG-IP system
automatically assigns the device group name to the root and /Common
folders. This ensures that the system synchronizes any traffic groups
for that device to the correct devices in the local trust domain.</li>
<li>The BIG-IP system creates all device groups and traffic-groups in the
/Common folder, regardless of the partition to which the system is
currently set.</li>
<li>If no Sync-Failover device group is defined on a device, then the
system sets the device group value that is assigned to the root and
/Common folders to None.</li>
<li>By default, on each device, the BIG-IP system assigns a Sync-Failover
device group to any sub-folders of the root or /Common folders that
inherit the device group attribute.</li>
<li>You can configure a maximum of 15 floating traffic groups for a
Sync-Failover device group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating a Sync-Failover device group</strong></p>
<p>This task establishes failover capability between two or more BIG-IP
devices. If the active device in a Sync-Failover device group becomes
unavailable, the configuration objects fail over to another member of
the device group and traffic processing is unaffected. You can perform
this task on any authority device within the local trust domain.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click Device Management &gt; Device Groups. The Device Groups screen displays a list of existing device groups.</li>
<li>On the Device Group List screen, click Create.</li>
<li>Type a name for the device group, select the device group type Sync-Failover, and type a description for the device group.</li>
<li>In the Configuration area of the screen, select a host name from the available list for each BIG-IP device that you want to include in the device group. Use the Move button to move the host name to the selected list.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Available list shows any devices that are members of the
device’s local trust domain but not currently members of a
Sync-Failover device group. A device can be a member of one
Sync-Failover group only.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>For Network Failover, select the Enabled check box.</li>
<li>Click Finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have a Sync-Failover type of device group containing BIG-IP
devices as members.</p>
<p><strong>About Sync-Only device groups</strong></p>
<p>One of the types of device groups that you can create is a Sync-Only
device group. A Sync-Only device group contains devices that synchronize
configuration data with one another, but their configuration data does
not fail over to other members of the device group. A Sync-Only device
group supports a maximum of 32 devices.</p>
<p>A device in a trust domain can be a member of more than one Sync-Only
device group. A device can also be a member of both a Sync-Failover
group and a Sync-Only group simultaneously.</p>
<p>A typical use of a Sync-Only device group is one in which you configure
a device to synchronize the contents of a specific folder to a different
device group than to the device group to which the other folders are
synchronized.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Sync-only device group</p>
<p><strong>Sample Sync-Only configuration</strong></p>
<p>The most common reason to use a Sync-Only device group is to synchronize
a specific folder containing policy data that you want to share across
all BIG-IP devices in a local trust domain, while setting up a
Sync-Failover device group to fail over the remaining configuration
objects to a subset of devices in the domain. In this configuration, you
are using a Sync-Only device group attribute on the policy folder to
override the inherited Sync-Failover device group attribute. Note that
in this configuration, BIGIP1 and BIGIP2 are members of both the
Sync-Only and the Sync-Failover groups.</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Sync-Only Device Group</p>
<p>To implement this configuration, you can follow this process:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a Sync-Only device group on the local device, adding all devices in the local trust domain as members.</li>
<li>Create a Sync-Failover device group on the local device, adding a subset of devices as members.</li>
<li>On the folder containing the policy data, use tmsh to set the value of the device group attribute to the name of the Sync-Only device group.</li>
<li>On the root folder, retain the default Sync-Failover device group assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creating a Sync-Only device group</strong></p>
<p>You perform this task to create a Sync-Only type of device group. When
you create a Sync-Only device group, the BIG-IP system can then
automatically synchronize certain types of data such as security
policies and acceleration applications and policies to the other devices
in the group, even when some of those devices reside in another network.
You can perform this task on any BIG-IP device within the local trust
domain.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click Device Management &gt; Device Groups.</li>
<li>On the Device Groups list screen, click Create. The New Device Group screen opens.</li>
<li>Type a name for the device group, select the device group type Sync-Only, and type a description for the device group.</li>
<li>From the Configuration list, select Advanced.</li>
<li>For the Members setting, select an IP address and host name from the Available list for each BIG-IP device that you want to include in the device group. Use the Move button to move the host name to the Includes list. The list shows any devices that are members of the device’s local trust domain.</li>
<li>For the Automatic Sync setting, select or clear the check box:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Select the check box when you want the BIG-IP system to automatically
sync the BIG-IP configuration data whenever a config sync operation
is required. In this case, the BIG-IP system syncs the configuration
data whenever the data changes on any device in the device group.</li>
<li>Clear the check box when you want to manually initiate each config
sync operation. In this case, F5 recommends that you perform
a config sync operation whenever configuration data changes on one of
the devices in the device group.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>For the Full Sync setting, select or clear the check box:</li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Select the check box when you want all sync operations to be full
syncs. In this case, the BIG-IP system syncs the entire set of BIG-IP
configuration data whenever a config sync operation is required.</li>
<li>Clear the check box when you want all sync operations to be
incremental (the default setting). In this case, the BIG-IP system
syncs only the changes that are more recent than those on the target
device. When you select this option, the BIG-IP system compares the
configuration data on each target device with the configuration data
on the source device and then syncs the delta of each target-source
pair.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you enable incremental synchronization, the BIG-IP system might
occasionally perform a full sync for internal reasons. This is a
rare occurrence and no user intervention is required.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li>In the Maximum Incremental Sync Size (KB) field, retain the default value of 1024, or type a different value. This value specifies the total size of configuration changes that can reside in the incremental sync cache. If the total size of the configuration changes in the cache exceeds the specified value, the BIG-IP system performs a full sync whenever the next config sync operation occurs.</li>
<li>Click Finished.</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have a Sync-Only type of device group containing BIG-IP devices
as members.</p>
<p><strong>A note about folders and overlapping device groups</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes when one BIG-IP object references another, one of the objects
gets synchronized to a particular device, but the other object does not.
This can result in an invalid device group configuration.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you create two device groups that share some
devices but not all. In the following illustration, Device A is a member
of both Device Group 1 and Device Group 2.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p151.png" src="../../_images/p151.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>One device with membership in two device groups</p>
<p>Device Group 1 is associated with folder /Common, and Device Group 2 is
associated with the folder /Common/my_app. This configuration causes
Device A to synchronize all of the data in folder /Common to Device B in
Device Group 1. The only data that Device A can synchronize to Device C
in Device Group 2 is the data in the folder /Common/my_app, because
this folder is associated with Device Group 2 instead of Device Group 1.</p>
<p>Now suppose that you create a pool in the /Common/my_app folder, which
is associated with Device Group 2. When you create the pool members in
that folder, the BIG-IP system automatically creates the associated node
addresses and puts them in folder /Common. This results in an invalid
configuration, because the node objects in folder /Common do not get
synchronized to the device on which the nodes’ pool members reside,
Device C. When an object is not synchronized to the device on which its
referenced objects reside, an invalid configuration results.</p>

<p><strong>2.06 - Explain how to configure HA groups</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-device-service-clustering-admin-11-5-0/8.html">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-device-service-clustering-admin-11-5-0/8.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Creating an HA group</strong></p>
<p>You use this task to create an HA group for a traffic group on a device
in a BIG-IP device group. Also known as fast failover, an HA group is
most useful when you want an active traffic group on a device to fail
over to another device based on trunk and pool availability, and on
VIPRION systems, also cluster availability. You can create multiple HA
groups on a single device, and you associate each HA group with the
local instance of a traffic group.</p>
<p>Important: Once you create an HA group on a device and associate the HA
group with a traffic group, you must create an HA group and associate it
with that same traffic group on every device in the device group. For
example, on Device_A, if you create HA_GroupA_TG1 and associate it
with trafffic-group-1, then on Device_B you can create HA_GroupB_TG1)
and also associate it with traffic-group-1.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click System &gt; High Availability &gt; HA Groups</li>
<li>In the HA Group Name field, type a name for the HA group, such as ha_group1.</li>
<li>Verify that the Enable check box is selected.</li>
<li>In the Active Bonus field, specify an integer the represents the
amount by which you want the system to increase the overall score of
the active device. The purpose of the active bonus is to prevent
failover when minor or frequent changes occur to the configuration of
a pool, trunk, or cluster.</li>
<li>In the table displayed along the bottom of the screen, for the
Threshold setting, for each pool, trunk, or VIPRION cluster in the HA
group, optionally specify an integer for a threshold value.</li>
<li>For the Weight setting, for each pool, trunk, or VIPRION cluster in
the HA group, specify an integer for the weight. The allowed weight
for an HA group object ranges from 10 through 100. This value is
required.</li>
<li>Click Create.</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have an HA group that the BIG-IP system can later use to
calculate an HA score for fast failover.</p>
<p>After creating an HA group on the local device, you must assign it to a
traffic group on the local device.</p>
<p><strong>Associating an HA group with a traffic group</strong></p>
<p>You use this task to associate an HA group with an existing traffic
group. Also known as fast failover, this configuration option is most
useful when you want an active traffic group to fail over to another
device due to trunk, pool, and/or VIPRION cluster availability
specifically. When you configure an HA group for a traffic group, you
ensure that the traffic group, when active, fails over to the device on
which the traffic group has the highest HA score.</p>
<p><em>Important</em>: HA groups are not included in config sync operations. For
this reason, you must create a separate HA group on every device in the
device group for this traffic group. For example, if the device group
contains three devices and you want to create an HA group for
traffic-group-1, you must configure the HA group property for
traffic-group-1 on each of the three devices separately. In a typical
device group configuration, the values of the HA group settings on the
traffic group will differ on each device.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click Device Management &gt; Traffic Groups.</li>
<li>In the Name column, click the name of a traffic group on the local device. This displays the properties of the traffic group.</li>
<li>From the Failover Methods list, select HA Group.</li>
<li>From the HA Group list, select an HA group.</li>
<li>Click Update.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you perform this task for this traffic group on each device group
member, the BIG-IP system ensures that this traffic group is always
active on the device with the highest HA score.</p>

<p><strong>Traffic Group Assignment</strong></p>
<p>You perform this task to add members to a newly-created or existing
traffic group. Traffic group members are the floating IP addresses
associated with application traffic passing through the BIG-IP system.
Typical members of a traffic group are: a floating self IP address, a
floating virtual address, and a floating SNAT translation address.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>From the Main tab, display the properties page for an existing BIG-IP object, such as a self IP address or a virtual address. For example, from the Main tab, click Network &gt; Self IPs, and then from the Self IPs list, click a self IP address.</li>
<li>From the Traffic Group list, select the floating traffic group that you want the BIG-IP object to join.</li>
<li>Click Update.</li>
</ol>
<p>After performing this task, the BIG-IP object belongs to the selected
traffic group.</p>
<p>Repeat this task for each BIG-IP object that you want to be a member of
the traffic group.</p>

<p><strong>MAC Masquerading</strong></p>
<p>Using MAC masquerading will reduce ARP convergence issues within the
BIG-IP LAN environments when a failover event happens.</p>
<p>To optimize the flow of traffic during failover events, you can
configure MAC masquerade addresses for any defined traffic groups on the
BIG-IP system. A MAC masquerade address is a unique, floating MAC
address that you create. You can assign one MAC masquerade address to
each traffic group on a BIG-IP device. By assigning a MAC masquerade
address to a traffic group, you associate that address with any floating
IP addresses associated with the traffic group. By configuring a MAC
masquerade address for each traffic group, a single Virtual Local Area
Network (VLAN) can potentially carry traffic and services for multiple
traffic groups, with each service having its own MAC masquerade address.</p>

<p>This topic is focused on predicting behaviors during failovers between
BIG-IP systems. Understanding how device groups and traffic groups
behave is the key to this topic. Experience with failing over HA systems
will give the candidate the ability to answer the questions on this
topic.</p>
<p>F5 introduced the Device Service Clustering (DSC) architecture in BIG-IP
11.x. DSC provides the framework for ConfigSync, and other
high-availability features, including the following components:</p>
<p><strong>Device trust and trust domains</strong></p>
<p>Device trust establishes trust relationships between BIG-IP devices
through certificate-based authentication. Each device generates a device
ID key and Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate upon upgrade or
installation. A trust domain is a collection of BIG-IP devices that
trust each other, and can synchronize and fail over their BIG-IP
configuration data, as well as regularly exchange status and failover
messages.</p>
<p>When the local BIG-IP device attempts to join a device trust with a
remote BIG-IP device, the following applies:</p>
<p>If the local BIG-IP device is added as a peer authority device, the
remote BIG-IP device presents a certificate signing request (CSR) to the
local device, which then signs the CSR and returns the certificate along
with its CA certificate and key.</p>
<p>If the local BIG-IP device is added as a subordinate (non-authority)
device, the remote BIG-IP device presents a CSR to the local device,
which then signs the CSR and returns the certificate. The CA certificate
and key are not presented to the remote BIG-IP device. The subordinate
device is unable to request other devices to join the device trust.</p>
<p><strong>Device groups</strong></p>
<p>A device group is a collection of BIG-IP devices that reside in the same
trust domain and are configured to securely synchronize their BIG-IP
configuration and failover when needed. Device groups can initiate a
ConfigSync operation from the device group member with the desired
configuration change. You can create two types of device groups:</p>
<p>A Sync-Failover device group contains devices that synchronize
configuration data and support traffic groups for failover purposes.</p>
<p>A Sync-Only device group contains devices that synchronize configuration
data, but do not synchronize failover objects and do not fail over to
other members of the device group.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic groups</strong></p>
<p>A traffic group represents a collection of related configuration objects
that are configured on a BIG-IP device. When a BIG-IP device becomes
unavailable, a traffic group can float to another device in a device
group.</p>
<p><strong>Folders</strong></p>
<p>A folder is a container for BIG-IP configuration objects. You can use
folders to set up synchronization and failover of configuration data in
a device group. You can sync all configuration data on a BIG-IP device,
or you can sync and fail over objects within a specific folder only.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized Management Infrastructure (CMI) communication channel</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system uses SSL certificates to establish a trust
relationship between devices. In a device trust, BIG-IP devices can act
as certificate signing authorities, peer authorities, or subordinate
non-authorities. When acting as a certificate signing authority, the
BIG-IP device signs x509 certificates for another BIG-IP device that is
in the local trust domain. The BIG-IP device for which a certificate
signing authority device signs its certificate is known as a subordinate
non-authority device.</p>

<p><strong>2.07 - Compare and contrast network and serial failover</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2397?sr=42496090">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2397?sr=42496090</a></p>
<p><strong>Network Failover</strong></p>
<p>Network failover is based on heartbeat detection where the system sends
heartbeat packets over the internal network.</p>
<p>The system uses the primary and secondary failover addresses to send
network failover heartbeat packets. For more information about the
BIG-IP mirroring and network failover transport protocols, refer to the
following articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K9057">K9057: Service port and protocol used for BIG-IP network
failover</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7225">K7225: Transport protocol used for BIG-IP connection and persistence
mirroring</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The BIG-IP system considers the peer down after the
Failover.NetTimeoutSec timeout value is exceeded. The default value of
Failover.NetTimeoutSec is three seconds, after which the standby unit
attempts to switch to an active state. The following database entry
represents the default settings for the failover time configuration:</p>
<p>Failover.NetTimeoutSec = 3</p>
<p>Device Service Clustering (DSC) was introduced in BIG-IP 11.0.0 and
allows many new features such as synchronization and failover between
two or more devices. Network failover provides communication between
devices for synchronization, failover, and mirroring and is required for
the following deployments:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sync-Failover device groups containing three or more devices</li>
<li>Active-active configurations between two BIG-IP platforms</li>
<li>BIG-IP VIPRION platforms</li>
<li>BIG-IP Virtual Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>An active-active pair must communicate over the network to indicate the
objects and resources they service. Otherwise, if network communications
fail, the two systems may attempt to service the same traffic management
objects, which could result in duplicate IP addresses on the network.</p>
<p>A broken network may cause BIG-IP systems to enter into active-active
mode. To avoid this issue, F5 recommends that you dedicate one interface
on each system to perform only failover communications and, when
possible, directly connect these two interfaces with an Ethernet cable
to avoid network problems that could cause the systems to go into an
active-active state.</p>
<p>Important: When you directly connect two BIG-IP systems with an
Ethernet cable, do not change the speed and duplex settings of the
interfaces involved in the connection. If you do, depending on the
BIG-IP software version, you may be required to use a crossover
cable. For more information, refer to SOL9787: Auto MDI/MDIX
behavior for BIG-IP platforms.</p>
<p>If you configure a BIG-IP high-availability pair to use network
failover, and the hardwired failover cable also connects the two units,
hardwired failover always has precedence; if network failover traffic is
compromised, the two units do not fail over because the hardwired
failover cable still connects them.</p>
<p><strong>Hardwired Failover</strong></p>
<p>Hardwired failover is also based on heartbeat detection, where one
BIG-IP system continuously sends voltage to another. If a response does
not initiate from one BIG-IP system, failover to the peer occurs in less
than one second. When BIG-IP redundant devices connect using a hardwired
failover cable, the system automatically enables hardwired failover.</p>
<p>The maximum hardwired cable length is 50 feet. Network failover is an
option if the distance between two BIG-IP systems exceeds the acceptable
length for a hardwired failover cable.</p>
<p>Note: For information about the failover cable wiring pinouts, refer
to <a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/1000/400/sol1426.html">SOL1426: Pinouts for the failover cable used with BIG-IP
platforms</a>.</p>
<p>Hardwired failover can only successfully be deployed between two
physical devices. In this deployment, hardwired failover can provide
faster failover response times than network failover. However, peer
state may be reported incorrectly when using hardwired failover alone.</p>
<p>Hardwired failover is only a heartbeat and carries no status
information. Communication over the network is necessary for certain
features to function properly. For example, Traffic Management
Microkernel (TMM) uses the network to synchronize packets and flow state
updates to peers for connection mirroring. To enable proper state
reporting and mirroring, F5 recommends that you configure network
failover in addition to hardwired failover.</p>

<p><strong>Failover Unicast and Multicast</strong></p>
<p>The unicast failover configuration uses a self-IP address and TMM switch
port to communicate failover packets between each BIG-IP appliance. For
appliance platforms, specifying two unicast addresses should suffice.</p>
<p>For VIPRION platforms, you should enable multicast and retain the
default multicast address that the BIG-IP system provides. The multicast
failover entry uses the management port to communicate failover packets
between each VIPRION system. As an alternative to configuring the
multicast failover option, you can define a unicast mesh using the
management port for each VIPRION system.</p>

<p><strong>2.08 - Determine the effect of iRules on performance</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/irules-optimization-101-05-evaluating-irule-performance">https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/irules-optimization-101-05-evaluating-irule-performance</a></p>
<p><strong>Effect of iRules on Performance</strong></p>
<p>This is a classic case of “It Depends”. Since iRules are written
individually to solve specific issues or do specific functions necessary
for a particular scenario, there is not a fixed sheet of performance
numbers showing how an iRule will impact performance. iRules do get
compiled into byte code, and can run at wire speed, but it really
depends on what you’re doing. Many times, there is more than one way to
write an iRule and one method may work more efficiently than another.</p>
<p>That said there are ways to see how an iRule is performing by collecting
and interpreting runtime statistics by inserting a timing command into
event declarations to see over all CPU usage when under load. This tool
will help you to create an iRule that is performing the best on your
system.</p>
<p><strong>Collecting Statistics</strong></p>
<p>To generate &amp; collect runtime statistics, you can insert the command
“timing on” into your iRule. When you run traffic through your iRule
with timing enabled, LTM will keep track of how many CPU cycles are
spent evaluating each iRule event. You can enable rule timing for the
entire iRule, or only for specific events.</p>
<p>To enable timing for the entire iRule, insert the “timing on” command at
the top of the rule before the first “when EVENT_NAME” clause.</p>
<p>With the timing command in place, each time the rule is evaluated, LTM
will collect the timing information for the requested events.</p>
<p>To get a decent average for each of the events, you’ll want to run at
least a couple thousand iterations of the iRule under the anticipated
production load.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing Statistics</strong></p>
<p>The statistics for your iRule (as measured in CPU cycles) may be viewed
at the command line or console by running</p>
<p>tmsh show ltm rule rule_name all</p>
<p>The output includes totals for executions, failures &amp; aborts along with
minimum, average &amp; maximum cycles consumed for each event since stats
were last cleared.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Evaluating statistics</strong></p>
<p>“Average cycles reported” is the most useful metric of real-world
performance, assuming a large representative load sample was evaluated.</p>
<p>The “maximum cycles reported” is often very large since it includes some
one-time and periodic system overhead. (More on that below.)</p>
<p>Here’s a spreadsheet (iRules Runtime Calculator) that will calculate
percentage of CPU load per iteration once you populate it with your
clock speed and the statistics gathered with the “timing” command.
(Clock speed can be found by running ‘cat /proc/cpuinfo’ at the command
line.)</p>
<p><strong>Caveats</strong></p>
<p>Timing is intended to be used only as an optimization/debug tool, and
does have a small impact on performance; so don’t leave it turned on
indefinitely.</p>
<p>Timing functionality seems to exhibit a 70 - 100 cycle margin of error.</p>
<p>Use average cycles for most analyses. Maximum cycles is not always an
accurate indicator of actual iRule performance, as the very first call a
newly edited iRule includes the cycles consumed for compile-time
optimizations, which will be reflected in an inflated maximum cycles
value. The simple solution to this is to wait until the first time the
rule is hit, then reset the statistics.</p>
<p>However, maximum cycles is also somewhat inflated by OS scheduling
overhead incurred at least once per tick, so the max value is often
overstated even if stats are cleared after compilation.</p>

<p><strong>Global Variable Impact</strong></p>
<p>iRules use global variables to make variable data that is created in one
context, that is available to other connections, virtual servers, and
Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) instances. If a virtual server
references an iRule that uses a global variable that is not Clustered
Multiprocessing (CMP) compatible, the virtual server will be ineligible
for CMP processing. In most cases, it is good to retain the benefits of
CMP processing when using iRules. This document expands on the various
ways to represent global variable data, making it available to other
connections, other virtual servers, and other TMM instances.</p>
<p>In many cases, variable data used in an iRule is required to be
available only within the scope of the current connection. The use of
TCL local variables satisfies this requirement and does not affect CMP
compatibility.</p>
<p>In other cases, variable data must be available globally, that is,
outside the context of a connection. The most common requirement people
have is to capture data from one connection, then to reference that data
from subsequent connections that are part of the same session. This
requirement can be further refined to include both multiple connections
traversing the same TMM instance, such as would be seen on a
non-CMP-enabled system or virtual server, and also multiple related
connections on CMP-enabled virtual servers, which may traverse different
TMM instances.</p>
<p>Another common use for global variables is to share data among multiple
iRules that run on the same BIG-IP system. For example, to set and
enforce a cumulative concurrent connection limit, an iRule would need to
both set a globally accessible limit value, and also allow each iRule
instance to update a separate globally-accessible counter value.</p>
<p>The use of global variables can force the BIG-IP system to automatically
disable CMP processing, which is known as demotion. Demotion of a
virtual server limits processing of that virtual server to only one CPU
core. This can adversely affect performance on multi-core BIG-IP
systems, as only a fraction of the available CPU resources are available
for each demoted virtual server. In addition, CMP demotion can create an
internal communication bottleneck for virtual servers that are
WebAccelerator-enabled or ASM-enabled.</p>
<p>The following sections explain each of three popular methods for sharing
iRules-derived data globally, including the CMP compatibility of each
method.</p>
<p><strong>Using TCL global variables</strong></p>
<p>TCL global variables are not actually global on a CMP-enabled BIG-IP
system, since the global variables are not shared among TMM instances.
TCL global variables are accessible globally only within the local TMM
instance (meaning that each TMM instance would need to set and update
separately its own copy of the variable and the value of the variable).
As a result, the TMM process running on one processor is not able to
access the contents of the same TCL global variable that was set by a
different TMM process, even if both TMM processes are handling
connections for the same virtual server. Because of this limitation, the
use of a TCL global variable in an iRule automatically demotes from CMP
any virtual server to which it is applied. This avoids the confusion
that would otherwise result from accessing and updating multiple
instances of the same “global” variable. Because the virtual server will
be automatically demoted from CMP, you should restrict the use of TCL
global variables to iRules that will be applied to virtual servers that
do not depend on CMP processing.</p>
<p><strong>Using static global variables</strong></p>
<p>If you must share static data (data that will never be modified by the
iRule itself) across CMP-enabled virtual servers, you can use a static
global variable. A static global variable stores data globally to the
entire BIG-IP system, and is set within each TMM instance each time the
iRule is initialized. The value of a static global variable is assumed
not to change unless the iRule is re-initialized. As a result, static
global variables must be set within the RULE_INIT event. Static global
variables set within the RULE_INIT event are propagated to all TMM
instances each time the iRule is initialized: when the iRule is loaded
at system startup, when the configuration is re-loaded, or when the
iRule is modified from within the BIG-IP Configuration utility and
saved.</p>
<p><em>Important</em>: While it is possible to use the set command to modify a
static global variable within the iRule and outside of the RULE_INIT
event, such modifications will not be propagated to each TMM instance;
they will be visible to only the TMM process on which the modification
was made, resulting in inconsistent values for the static global
variable across TMM instances. As a result, F5 strongly recommends that
you do not update the value of any static global variable within the
iRule.</p>
<p><strong>Using the session table to store global variables</strong></p>
<p>If you must share non-static global data across CMP-enabled virtual
servers, you can use the session table to store and reference the data.
Session table data is shared among all TMM instances. Using the session
table imposes considerable operational overhead, but the preservation of
CMP processing for the virtual server typically far outweighs any such
impact.</p>
<p>You can use the table command to manipulate the session table. For
details, refer to the DevCentral article linked in the Supplemental
Information section below.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, there are several different options for using global
variables, or the equivalent functionality, in session tables. Each of
these options has advantages and disadvantages in their use. Typically,
these decisions are made on performance and ease of implementation.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TCL global variables</li>
<li>You should restrict the use of TCL global variables to iRules that will
be applied to virtual servers that do not depend on CMP processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Static global variables</p>
<p>The use of static global variables is recommended for sharing static
data (data that will not be updated by any iRule) among TMM instances
that are used by CMP-enabled virtual servers, or for sharing static data
among multiple iRules without affecting the CMP status of any virtual
server to which it is applied.</p>
<p>Session table</p>
<p>The use of the session table is recommended for sharing dynamic global
variable data (data that will be updated within the iRule) among
CMP-enabled virtual servers.</p>

<p><strong>2.08 - Determine the effect of RAM cache on performance and memory</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/techdocs/home/solutions/related/ramcache.pdf">https://support.f5.com/techdocs/home/solutions/related/ramcache.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>Effect of RAM Cache on Performance</strong></p>
<p>The largest effect of using the RAM Cache feature on the BIG-IP system
is system memory utilization. There is a finite amount of RAM in every
system and using any amount of that RAM for caching HTTP objects can
impact performance and even limit provisioning additional licensing
options.</p>
<p><strong>RAM Cache</strong></p>
<p>A RAM Cache is a cache of HTTP objects stored in the BIG-IP system’s RAM
that are reused by subsequent connections to reduce the amount of load
on the back-end servers.</p>
<p><strong>When to use the RAM Cache</strong></p>
<p>The RAM Cache feature provides the ability to reduce the traffic load to
back-end servers. This ability is useful if an object on a site is under
high demand, if the site has a large quantity of static content, or if
the objects on the site are compressed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>High demand objects</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is useful if a site has periods of high demand for
specific content. With RAM Cache configured, the content server only
has to serve the content to the BIG-IP system once per expiration
period.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Static content</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature is also useful if a site consists of a large quantity
of static content such as CSS, javascript, or images and logos.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Content compression</li>
</ul>
<p>For compressible data, the RAM Cache can store data for clients that
can accept compressed data. When used in conjunction with the
compression feature on the BIG-IP system, the RAM Cache takes stress
off of the BIG-IP system and the content servers.</p>
<p><strong>Items you can cache</strong></p>
<p>The RAM Cache feature is fully compliant with the cache specifications
described in RFC 2616, Hypertext Transfer Protocol – HTTP/1.1. This
means you can configure RAM Cache to cache the following content types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>200, 203, 206, 300, 301, and 410 responses</li>
<li>Responses to GET methods by default.</li>
<li>Other HTTP methods for URIs specified in the URI Include list or
specified in an iRule.</li>
<li>Content based on the User-Agent and Accept-Encoding values. The RAM
Cache holds different content for Vary headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The items that the RAM Cache does not cache are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Private data specified by cache control headers</li>
<li>By default, the RAM Cache does not cache HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE,
and CONNECT methods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Understanding the RAM Cache mechanism</strong></p>
<p>The default RAM Cache configuration caches only the HTTP GET methods.
You can use the RAM Cache to cache both the GET and other methods,
including non-HTTP methods, by specifying a URI in the URI Include list
or writing an iRule.</p>

<p><strong>2.08 - Determine the effect of compression on performance</strong></p>

<p><strong>Effect of Compression on Performance</strong></p>
<p>The function of data compression is highly CPU intensive. The largest
effect of using the RAM Cache feature on the BIG-IP system is system
memory utilization. There is a finite amount of RAM in every system and
using any amount of that RAM for caching HTTP objects can impact
performance and even limit provisioning additional licensing options.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Compression</strong></p>
<p>An optional feature is the BIG-IP systems ability to off-load HTTP
compression tasks from the target server. All of the tasks needed to
configure HTTP compression in Local Traffic Manager, as well as the
compression software itself, are centralized on the BIG-IP system.</p>
<p><strong>gzip compression levels</strong></p>
<p>A gzip compression level defines the extent to which data is compressed,
as well as the compression rate. You can set the gzip level in the range
of 1 through 9. The higher the gzip level, the better the quality of the
compression, and therefore the more resources the system must use to
reach that specified quality. Setting a gzip level yields these results:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A lower number causes data to be less compressed but at a higher
performance rate. Thus, a value of 1 causes the least compression but
the fastest performance.</li>
<li>A higher number causes data to be more compressed but at a slower
performance rate. Thus, a value of 9 (the highest possible value)
causes the most compression, but the slowest performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning: Selecting any value other than 1 - Least Compression (Fastest)
can degrade system performance.</p>
<p>For example, you might set the gzip compression level to 9 if you are
utilizing Local Traffic Manager cache feature to store response data.
The reason for this is that the stored data in the cache is continually
re-used in responses, and therefore you want the quality of the
compression of that data to be very high.</p>
<p>As the traffic flow on the BIG-IP system increases, the system
automatically decreases the compression quality from the gzip
compression level that you set in the profile. When the gzip compression
level decreases to the point where the hardware compression provider is
capable of providing the specified compression level, the system uses
the hardware compression providers rather than the software compression
providers to compress the HTTP server responses.</p>
<p>Tip: You can change the way that Local Traffic Manager uses gzip levels
to compress data by configuring the compression strategy. The
compression strategy determines the particular compression provider
(hardware or software) that the system uses for HTTP responses. The
available strategies are: Speed (the default strategy), Size, Ratio, and
Adaptive.</p>
<p>Memory levels for gzip compression</p>
<p>You can define the number of kilobytes of memory that Local Traffic
Manager uses to compress data when using the gzip or deflate compression
method. The memory level is a power-of-2 integer, in bytes, ranging from
1 to 256.</p>
<p>Generally, a higher value causes Local Traffic Manager to use more
memory, but results in a faster and higher compression ratio.
Conversely, a lower value causes Local Traffic Manager to use less
memory, but results in a slower and lower compression ratio.</p>

<p><strong>2.08 - Determine the effect of modules on performance and memory</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-system-essentials-11-6-0/7.html?sr=42462566">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-system-essentials-11-6-0/7.html?sr=42462566</a></p>
<p><strong>Effect of Modules on Performance</strong></p>
<p>Enabling additional software on any F5 hardware platform will increase
the utilization of the hardware resources of the unit. As you provision
the software modules in TMOS the Resource Provisioning screen will show
the administrator how much CPU, Disk and Memory is being used by each
module. And if provisioning an additional module requires more resources
than are available on the system, the system will not allow the
provisioning of the module.</p>
<p>Resource Provisioning is a management feature to help support the
installation and configuration of many modules available with BIG-IP.
Provisioning gives you some control over the resources, both CPU and
RAM, which are allocated to each licensed module. You may want, for
example, to minimize the resources available to GTM on a system licensed
for LTM and GTM. Since all models have some reliance on both management
(Linux) and local traffic features, they will always be provisioned.
Other modules must be manually provisioned. When you provision the
modules, you can choose between four levels of resources. A fifth level
may be allowed on certain modules. Dedicated, Nominal, Minimum and None
are available for all modules and Lite is a fifth level available for
trials only.</p>
<p>You can manage the provisioning of system memory, disk space, and CPU
usage among licensed modules on the BIG-IP system.</p>
<p>There are five available resource allocation settings for modules.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>None/Disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies that a module is not provisioned. A module that is not
provisioned does not run.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies that the system allocates all CPU, memory, and disk
resources to one module. When you select this option, the system
sets all other modules to None (Disabled).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nominal</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies that, when first enabled, a module gets the least amount
of resources required. Then, after all modules are enabled, the
module gets additional resources from the portion of remaining
resources.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Minimum</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifies that when the module is enabled, it gets the least amount
of resources required. No additional resources are ever allocated to
the module.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lite</li>
</ul>
<p>Lite is available for selected modules granting limited features for
trials.</p>
<p><strong>Provisioning the BIG-IP system using the Configuration utility</strong></p>
<p>After you have activated a license on the BIG-IP® system, you can
use the Configuration utility to provision the licensed modules.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click System &gt; Resource Provisioning.</li>
<li>For licensed modules, select either Minimum or Nominal, as needed.</li>

<p><strong>2.09 - Explain how to use traffic groups to maximize capacity</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-device-service-clustering-admin-11-5-0/8.html">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-device-service-clustering-admin-11-5-0/8.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Traffic Groups</strong></p>
<p>A traffic group is a collection of related configuration objects, such
as a floating self IP address, a virtual IP address, and a SNAT
translation address, that run on a BIG-IP device. Together, these
objects process a particular type of application traffic on that device.
When a BIG-IP device becomes unavailable, a traffic group floats (that
is, fails over) to another device in a device group to ensure that
application traffic continues to be processed with little to no
interruption in service. In general, a traffic group ensures that when a
device becomes unavailable, all of the failover objects in the traffic
group fail over to any one of the available devices in the device group.</p>
<p>A traffic group is initially active on the device on which you create
it, until the traffic group fails over to another device. For example,
if you initially create three traffic groups on Device A, these traffic
groups remain active on Device A until one or more traffic groups fail
over to another device. If you want an active traffic group to become
active on a different device in the device group when failover has not
occurred, you can intentionally force the traffic group to switch to a
standby state, thereby causing failover to another device.</p>
<p>Only objects with floating IP addresses can be members of a floating
traffic group.</p>
<p>An example of a set of objects in a traffic group is an iApps
application service. If a device with this traffic group is a member of
a device group, and the device becomes unavailable, the traffic group
floats to another member of the device group, and that member becomes
the device that processes the application traffic.</p>
<p>Note: A Sync-Failover device group can support a maximum of 15 floating
traffic groups.</p>
<p><strong>Maximizing Capacity</strong></p>
<p>For every active traffic group on a device, the BIG-IP system identifies
the device that is to be the next-active device if failover of that
active traffic group occurs. A next-active device is the device on which
a traffic group will become active if that traffic group eventually
fails over to another device. This next-active designation changes
continually depending on which devices are currently available in the
device group.</p>
<p>There are various configuration options for you to choose from to affect
the BIG-IP system’s selection of the next-active device for failover:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Load-aware failover</li>
<li>An ordered list with auto-failback</li>
<li>HA groups</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is load-aware failover?</strong></p>
<p>Load-aware failover is a BIG-IP feature designed for use in a
Sync-Failover device group. Configuring load-aware failover ensures that
the traffic load on all devices in a device group is as equivalent as
possible, factoring in any differences in device capacity and the amount
of application traffic that traffic groups process on a device. The
load-aware configuration option is most useful for device groups with
heterogeneous hardware platforms or varying application traffic loads
(or both).</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have a heterogeneous three-member device group
in which one device (BIGIP_C) has twice the hardware capacity of the
other two devices (BIGIP_A and BIGIP_B).</p>
<p>If the device group has four active traffic groups that each process the
same amount of application traffic, then the load on all devices is
equivalent when devices BIGIP_A and BIGIP_B each contain one active
traffic group, while device BIGIP_C contains two active traffic groups.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system implements load-aware failover by calculating a
numeric, current utilization score for each device, based on numeric
values that you specify for each device and traffic group relative to
the other devices and traffic groups in the device group. The system
then uses this current utilization score to determine which device is
the best device in the group to become the next-active device when
failover occurs for a traffic group.</p>
<p>The overall result is that the traffic load on each device is as
equivalent as possible in a relative way, that is, factoring in
individual device capacity and application traffic load per traffic
group.</p>
<p><strong>About device utilization calculation</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system on each device performs a calculation to determine the
device’s current level of utilization. This utilization level indicates
the ability for the device to be the next-active device in the event
that an active traffic group on another device must fail over within a
heterogeneous device group.</p>
<p>The calculation that the BIG-IP performs to determine the current
utilization of a device is based on these factors:</p>
<p><strong>Device capacity</strong></p>
<p>A local device capacity relative to other device group members.</p>
<p><strong>Active local traffic groups</strong></p>
<p>The number of active traffic groups on the local device.</p>
<p><strong>Active remote traffic groups</strong></p>
<p>The number of remote active traffic groups for which the local device is
the next-active device.</p>
<p>A multiplying load factor for each active traffic group</p>
<p>A multiplier value for each traffic group. The system uses this value to
weight each active traffic group’s traffic load compared to the traffic
load of each of the other active traffic groups in the device group.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system uses all of these factors to perform a calculation to
determine, at any particular moment, a score for each device that
represents the current utilization of that device. This utilization
score indicates whether the BIG-IP system should, in its attempt to
equalize traffic load on all devices, designate the device as a
next-active device for an active traffic group on another device in the
device group.</p>
<p>The calculation that the BIG-IP performs for each device is:</p>
<p>(The sum of all local active traffic group HA load factors + The sum of
all remote active traffic group HA load factors) / device capacity</p>
<p><strong>About HA capacity</strong></p>
<p>For each device in a BIG-IP device group, you can assign a high
availability (HA) capacity value. An HA capacity value is a number that
represents the relative processing capacity of that device compared to
the other devices in a device group. Assigning different HA capacity
values to the devices in the device group is useful when the device
group contains heterogeneous hardware platforms.</p>
<p>For example, if the device group has two devices with equal capacity and
a third device that has twice the capacity of each of the other two
devices, then you can assign values of 2, 2, and 4, respectively. You
can assign any number to represent the HA capacity, as long as the
number reflects the device’s relative capacity compared to the other
devices in the device group.</p>

<p><strong>2.10 - Determine the effect of connection mirroring on performance</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13478">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13478</a></p>
<p><strong>Connection Mirroring Performance Implications</strong></p>
<p>The connection and persistence mirroring feature allows you to configure
a BIG-IP system to duplicate connection and persistence information to
the standby unit of a redundant pair. This setting provides higher
reliability, but might affect system performance.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP device service clustering (DSC) architecture allows you to
create a redundant system configuration for multiple BIG-IP devices on a
network. System redundancy includes the ability to mirror connection and
persistence information to a peer device to prevent interruption in
service during failover. Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) manages
the state mirroring mechanism, and connection and persistence data is
synchronized to the standby unit with every packet or flow state update.
The standby unit decapsulates the packets and adds them to the
connection table.</p>
<p>Beginning with version 11.4.0, the BIG-IP system maintains a separate
mirroring channel for each traffic group. The active BIG-IP system in an
HA device group dynamically establishes a mirroring connection to the
standby with a status of Next Active for a given traffic group. The port
range for each connection channel begins at TCP 1029 and increments by
one for each new traffic group and channel created. For more
information, refer to K14894: The BIG-IP system establishes a separate
mirroring channel for each traffic group.</p>
<p>In BIG-IP 12.0.0 and later, you can configure the system to mirror
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connections that are terminated by the BIG-IP
system to peer device group members. For more information, refer to
K17391: Configuring SSL connection mirroring.</p>
<p>You can use the Configuration utility or Traffic Management Shell (tmsh)
to configure mirroring addresses, configure connection mirroring for
virtual servers and Secure Network Address Translations (SNATs), and
configure persistence mirroring. You can also view mirroring data on the
active and standby BIG-IP systems using the tmsh utility.</p>
<p>This feature can add CPU overhead to the system and can also cause
network congestion depending on the system configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>When configuring mirroring on the BIG-IP system, F5 recommends that you
consider the following factors:</p>
<p>Note: Only FastL4 and SNAT connections are re-mirrored after
failback.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enable connection and persistence mirroring when a BIG-IP failover
would cause the user’s session to be lost or significantly disrupted</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, where long-term connections, such as FTP and Telnet,
are good candidates for mirroring, mirroring short-term connections,
such as HTTP and UDP, is not recommended as this causes a decrease
in system performance. In addition, mirroring HTTP and UDP
connections is typically not necessary, as those protocols allow for
failure of individual requests without loss of the entire session.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure a dedicated VLAN and dedicated interfaces to process
mirroring traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>The TMM process manages the BIG-IP LTM state mirroring mechanism,
and connection data is synchronized to the standby unit with every
packet or flow state update. In some mirroring configurations, this
behavior may generate a significant amount of traffic. Using a
shared VLAN and shared interfaces for both mirroring and production
traffic reduces the overall link capacity for either type of
traffic. Due to high traffic volumes, production traffic and
mirroring traffic may interfere, potentially causing latency in
mirrored connections or interrupting the network mirror connection
between the two BIG-IP devices. If the network mirror connection is
interrupted, it can cause loss of mirror information and interfere
with the ability of the peer device to take over connections in the
event of a failover.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Directly cable network mirroring interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>You can directly cable network mirroring interfaces on the BIG-IP
systems in the failover pair, and F5 highly recommends that you do
this when configuring a dedicated VLAN for mirroring. Configuring
the pair in this way removes the need to allocate additional ports
on surrounding switches, and removes the possibility of switch
failure and switch-induced latency. Interfaces used for mirroring
should be dedicated to the mirroring VLAN. Tagged interfaces shared
with other VLANs could become saturated by traffic on other VLANs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Configure both primary and secondary mirroring addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>This would allow an alternate mirroring path and ensure reliable
mirroring in the event of equipment or cable failure.</p>

<p><strong>2.11 - Identify the performance impact of vCMP guests on other guests</strong></p>

<p><strong>Flexible Resource Allocation</strong></p>
<p>Flexible resource allocation is a built-in vCMP feature that allows vCMP
host administrators to optimize the use of available system resources.
Flexible resource allocation gives you the ability to configure the vCMP
host to allocate a different amount of CPU and memory to each guest
through core allocation, based on the needs of the specific BIG-IP
modules provisioned within a guest. When you create each guest, you
specify the number of logical cores that you want the host to allocate
to the guest, and you identify the specific slots that you want the host
to assign to the guest. Configuring these settings determines the total
amount of CPU and memory that the host allocates to the guest. With
flexible allocation, you can customize CPU and memory allocation in
granular ways that meet the specific resource needs of each individual
guest.</p>
<p><strong>Resource allocation planning</strong></p>
<p>When you create a vCMP guest, you must decide the amount of dedicated
resource, in the form of CPU and memory, that you want the vCMP host to
allocate to the guest. You can allocate a different amount of resources
to each guest on the system.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite hardware considerations</strong></p>
<p>Blade models vary in terms of how many cores the blade provides and how
much memory each core contains. Also variable is the maximum number of
guests that each blade model supports. For example, a single B2100 blade
provides eight cores and approximately 3 gigabytes (GB) of memory per
core, and supports a maximum of four guests.</p>
<p>Before you can determine the number of cores to allocate to a guest and
the number of slots to assign to a guest, you should understand:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The total number of cores that the blade model provides</li>
<li>The amount of memory that each blade model provides</li>
<li>The maximum number of guests that the blade model supports</li>
</ul>
<p>By understanding these metrics, you ensure that the total amount of
resource you allocate to guests is aligned with the amount of resource
that your blade model supports.</p>
<p>For specific information on the resources that each blade model
provides, see the vCMP guest memory/CPU core allocation matrix on the
AskF5 Knowledge Base at <a class="reference external" href="http://support.f5.com">http://support.f5.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding guest resource requirements</strong></p>
<p>Before you create vCMP guests and allocate system resources to them, you
need to determine the specific CPU and memory needs of each guest. You
can then decide how many cores to allocate and slots to assign to a
guest, factoring in the resource capacity of your blade model.</p>
<p>To determine the CPU and memory resource needs, you must know:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The number of guests you need to create</li>
<li>The specific BIG-IP modules you need to provision within each guest</li>
<li>The combined memory requirement of all BIG-IP modules within each
guest</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About core allocation for a guest</strong></p>
<p>When you create a guest on the vCMP system, you must specify the total
number of cores that you want the host to allocate to the guest based on
the guest’s total resource needs. Each core provides some amount of CPU
and a fixed amount of memory. You should therefore specify enough cores
to satisfy the combined memory requirements of all BIG-IP modules that
you provision within the guest. When you deploy the guest, the host
allocates this number of cores to every slot on which the guest runs,
regardless of the number of slots you have assigned to the guest.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the total amount of memory available
to a guest is only as much as the host has allocated to each slot. If
you instruct the host to allocate a total of two cores per slot for the
guest (for example, 6 GB of memory depending on blade model) and you
configure the guest to run on four slots, the host does not aggregate
the 6 GB of memory on each slot to provide 24 GB of memory for the
guest. Instead, the guest still has a total of 6 GB of memory available.
This is because blades in a chassis operate as a cluster of independent
devices, which ensures that if the number of blades for the guest is
reduced for any reason, the remaining blades still have the required
memory available to process the guest traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Formula for host memory allocation to a guest</strong></p>
<p>You can use a formula to confirm that the cores you plan to allocate to
a specific guest are sufficient, given the guest’s total memory
requirements:</p>
<p>(total_GB_memory_per_blade - 3 GB) x (cores_per_slot_per_guest /
total_cores_per_blade) = amount of guest memory allocation from host</p>
<p>Important: For metrics on memory and CPU support per blade model,
refer to the vCMP guest memory/CPU allocation matrix at
<a class="reference external" href="http://support.f5.com">http://support.f5.com</a>.</p>
<p>The variables in this formula are defined as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>total_GB_memory_per_blade</li>
</ul>
<p>The total amount of memory in gigabytes that your specific blade
model provides (for all guests combined).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>cores_per_slot_per_guest</li>
</ul>
<p>The estimated number of cores needed to provide the total amount of
memory that the guest requires.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>total_cores_per_blade</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of cores that your specific blade model provides
(for all guests combined).</p>
<p>For example, if you have a VIPRION 2150 blade, which provides
approximately 32 GB memory through a maximum of eight cores, and you
estimate that the guest will need two cores to satisfy the guest’s total
memory requirement of 8 GB, the formula looks as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(32 GB - 3 GB) x (2 cores / 8 cores) = 7.25 GB memory that the host will allocate to the guest per slot</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the formula shows that two cores will not provide
sufficient memory for the guest. If you specify four cores per slot
instead of two, the formula shows that the guest will have
sufficient memory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(32 GB - 3 GB) x (4 cores / 8 cores) = 14.5 GB memory that the host will allocate to the guest per slot</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that except for single-core guests, the host always allocates
cores in increments of two. For example, for B2150 blade models, the
host allocates cores in increments of 2, 4, and 8.</p>
<p>Once you use this formula for each of the guests you plan to create on a
slot, you can create your guests so that the combined memory allocation
for all guests on a slot does not exceed the total amount of memory that
the blade model provides.</p>
<p><strong>About slot assignment for a guest</strong></p>
<p>On the vCMP system, the host assigns some number of slots to each guest
based on information you provide when you initially create the guest.
The key information that you provide for slot assignment is the maximum
and minimum number of slots that a host can allocate to the guest, as
well as the specific slots on which the guest is allowed to run. With
this information, the host determines the number of slots and the
specific slot numbers to assign to each guest.</p>
<p>As a best practice, you should configure every guest so that the guest
can span all slots in the cluster whenever possible. The more slots that
the host can assign to a guest, the lighter the load is on each blade
(that is, the fewer the number of connections that each blade must
process for that guest).</p>
<p>Note: In device service clustering (DSC) configurations, all guests in
the device group must have the same core allocation and module
provisioning, and the guests must match with respect to number of slots
and the exact slot numbers. Also, each guest in the device group must
run on the same blade and chassis models.</p>
<p><strong>About single-core guests</strong></p>
<p>On platforms with hard drives, the vCMP host always allocates cores on a
slot for a guest in increments of two cores. In the case of blades with
solid-state drives, however, the host can allocate a single core to a
guest, but only for a guest that requires one core only; the host never
allocates any other odd number of cores per slot for a guest (such as
three, five, or seven cores).</p>
<p>The illustration shows a possible configuration where the host has
allocated a single core to one of the guests.</p>

<p>A vCMP configuration with a single-core guest</p>
<p>Because a single-core guest has a relatively small amount of CPU and
memory allocated to it, F5 supports only these products or
product combinations for a single-core guest:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) only</li>
<li>BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager (LTM) and BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager
(GTM) only</li>
<li>BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager (GTM) standalone only</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resource allocation results</strong></p>
<p>This illustration shows an example of a system with three guests that
the vCMP host has distributed across slots in varying ways. The way that
the host distributes the guests depends on the way you configured guest
properties when you initially created each guest.</p>

</div>
<p>Three guests with varying amounts of core allocation and slot assignment</p>
<p>This illustration shows three guests configured on the system. For blade
model B2100, which provides approximately 2 GB of memory per core:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The blue guest is configured with two cores per slot, providing a
total memory allocation of four GB per slot for the guest (2 cores x
2 GB). The guest spans four slots.</li>
<li>The red guest is configured with two cores per slot, providing a
total memory allocation of four GB per slot for the guest (2 cores x
2 GB). The guest spans two slots.</li>
<li>The green guest is configured with four cores per slot, providing a
total memory allocation of eight GB per slot for the guest (4 cores x
2 GB). The guest spans two slots.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important</em>: For an individual guest, the number of cores allocated to
one (not all) of the guest’s slots determines the guest’s total memory
allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability considerations</strong></p>
<p>When managing a guest’s slot assignment, or when removing a blade from a
slot assigned to a guest, there are a few key concepts to consider.</p>
<p><strong>About initial slot assignment</strong></p>
<p>When you create a vCMP guest, the number of slots that you initially
allow the guest to run on determines the maximum total resource
allocation possible for that guest, even if you add blades later. For
example, in a four-slot VIPRION chassis that contains two blades, if you
allow a guest to run on two slots only and you later add a third blade,
the guest continues to run on two slots and does not automatically
expand to acquire additional resource from the third blade. However, if
you initially allow the guest to run on all slots in the cluster, the
guest will initially run on the two existing blades but will expand to
run on the third slot, acquiring additional traffic processing capacity,
if you add another blade.</p>
<p>Because each connection causes some amount of memory use, the fewer the
connections that the blade is processing, the lower the percentage of
memory that is used on the blade compared to the total amount of memory
allocated on that slot for the guest. Configuring each guest to span as
many slots as possible reduces the chance that memory use will exceed
the available memory on a blade when that blade must suddenly process
additional connections.</p>
<p>If you do not follow the best practice of instructing the host to assign
as many slots as possible for a guest, you should at least allow the
guest to run on enough slots to account for an increase in load per
blade if the number of blades is reduced for any reason.</p>
<p>In general, F5 strongly recommends that when you create a
guest, you assign the maximum number of available slots to the guest to
ensure that as few additional connections as possible are redistributed
to each blade, therefore resulting in as little increase in memory use
on each blade as possible.</p>
<p><strong>About changing slot assignments</strong></p>
<p>At any time, you can intentionally increase or decrease the number of
slots a guest runs on explicitly by re-configuring the number of slots
that you initially assigned to the guest. Note that you can do this
while a guest is processing traffic, to either increase the guest’s
resource allocation or to reclaim host resources.</p>
<p>When you increase the number of slots that a guest is assigned to, the
host attempts to assign the guest to those additional slots. The host
first chooses those slots with the greatest number of available cores.
The change is accepted as long as the guest is still assigned to at
least as many slots as dictated by its Minimum Number of Slotsvalue. If
the additional number of slots specified is not currently available, the
host waits until those additional slots become available and then
assigns the guest to these slots until the guest is assigned to the
desired total number of slots. If the guest is currently in a deployed
state, VMs are automatically created on the additional slots.</p>
<p>When you decrease the number of slots that a guest is assigned to, the
host removes the guest from the most populated slots until the guest is
assigned to the correct number of slots. The guest’s VMs on the removed
slots are deleted, although the virtual disks remain on those slots for
reassignment later to another guest. Note that the number of slots that
you assign to a guest can never be less than the minimum number of slots
configured for that guest.</p>
<p><strong>Effect of blade removal on a guest</strong></p>
<p>If a blade suddenly becomes unavailable, the total traffic processing
resource for guests on that blade is reduced and the host must
redistribute the load on that slot to the remaining assigned slots. This
increases the number of connections that each remaining blade must
process.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is no reduction in memory allocation, given that when
you create a guest, you instruct the host to allocate the full amount of
required memory for that guest to every slot in the guest’s cluster
(through the guest’s Cores per Slot property). However, each connection
causes some amount of memory use, which means that when a blade becomes
unavailable and the host redistributes its connections to other blades,
the percentage of memory use on these remaining blades increases. In
some cases, the increased memory use could exceed the amount of memory
allocated to each of those slots.</p>
<p>For example, if a guest spans three slots which process 1,000,000
connections combined, each slot is processing a third of the connections
to the guest. If one of the blades becomes unavailable, reducing the
guest’s cluster to two slots, then the two remaining blades must each
process half of the guest’s connections (500,000), resulting in a memory
use per slot that could be higher than what is allocated for that slot.
Assigning as many slots as possible to each guest reduces this risk.</p>
<p><strong>Effect of blade re-insertion on a guest</strong></p>
<p>When you remove a blade from the chassis, the host remembers which
guests were allocated to that slot. If you then re-insert a blade into
that slot, the host automatically allocates cores from that blade to the
guests that were previously assigned to that slot.</p>
<p>Whenever the host assigns guests to a newly-inserted blade, those guests
that are below their Minimum Number of Slots threshold are given
priority; that is, the host assigns those guests to the slot before
guests that are already assigned to at least as many slots as their
Minimum Number of Slots value. Note that this is the only time when a
guest is allowed to be assigned to fewer slots than specified by its
Minimum Number of Slots value.</p>
<p><strong>About SSL and compression hardware</strong></p>
<p>On systems that include SSL and compression hardware processors, the
vCMP feature shares these hardware resources among all guests on the
system, in a round robin fashion.</p>
<p>When sharing SSL hardware, if all guests are using similar-sized keys,
then each guest receives an equal share of the SSL resource. Also, if
any guests are not using SSL keys, then other guests can take advantage
of the extra SSL resource.</p>
<p><strong>Guest states and resource allocation</strong></p>
<p>As a vCMP host administrator, you can control when the system allocates
or de-allocates system resources to a guest. You can do this at any
time, by setting a guest to one of three states: Configured,
Provisioned, or Deployed. These states affect resource allocation in
these ways:</p>
<p><strong>Configured</strong></p>
<p>This is the initial (and default) state for a newly-created guest. In
this state, the guest is not running, and no resources are allocated. If
you change a guest from another state to the Configured state, the vCMP
host does not delete any virtual disks that were previously attached to
that guest; instead, the guest’s virtual disks persist on the system.
The host does, however, automatically de-allocate other resources such
as CPU and memory. When the guest is in the Configured state, you cannot
configure the BIG-IP modules that are licensed to run within the guest;
instead, you must set the guest to the Deployed state to provision and
configure the BIG-IP modules within the guest.</p>
<p><strong>Provisioned</strong></p>
<p>When you change a guest state from Configured to Provisioned, the vCMP
host allocates system resources to the guest (CPU, memory, and any
unallocated virtual disks). If the guest is new, the host creates new
virtual disks for the guest and installs the selected ISO image on them.
A guest does not run while in the Provisioned state. When you change a
guest state from Deployed to Provisioned, the host shuts down the guest
but retains its current resource allocation.</p>
<p><strong>Deployed</strong></p>
<p>When you change a guest to the Deployed state, the vCMP host activates
the guest virtual machines (VMs), and the guest administrator can then
provision and configure the BIG-IP modules within the guest. For a guest
in this state, the vCMP host starts and maintains a VM on each slot for
which the guest has resources allocated. If you are a host administrator
and you reconfigure the properties of a guest after its initial
deployment, the host immediately propagates the changes to all of the
guest VMs and also propagates the list of allowed VLANs.</p>

<p><strong>BIG-IP license considerations for vCMP</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system license authorizes you to provision the vCMP feature
and create guests with one or more BIG-IP system modules provisioned.
Note the following considerations:</p>
<p>Each guest inherits the license of the vCMP host.</p>
<p>The host license must include all BIG-IP modules that are to be
provisioned across all guest instances. Examples of BIG-IP modules are
BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager and BIG-IP Global Traffic Manager.</p>
<p>The license allows you to deploy the maximum number of guests that the
platform allows.</p>
<p>If the license includes the appliance mode feature, you cannot enable
appliance mode for individual guests; when licensed, appliance mode
applies to all guests and cannot be disabled.</p>
<p>You activate the BIG-IP system license when you initially set up the
vCMP host.</p>

<p><strong>vCMP host and compatible guest version matrix</strong></p>
<p>Starting in BIG-IP 11.0.0, the BIG-IP system supports vCMP, a feature
that allows you to run multiple instances of the BIG-IP software on a
single hardware platform. The hypervisor allows you to allocate hardware
resources to each BIG-IP vCMP guest instance.</p>
<p>The vCMP host allows you to run a vCMP guest software version, which can
be either the same version or a different version than the host, which
is BIG-IP 11.0.0 and later. This functionality allows customers to run
multiple versions of BIG-IP code simultaneously for testing, migration
staging, or environment consolidation.</p>

<p><strong>2.12 - Explain the implications of SNAT and NAT on network promiscuity</strong></p>
<p>In a typical network, a host’s network adapter only receives frames that
are meant for it. If the Host’s network adapter supports promiscuous
mode, then placing it in promiscuous mode will allow it to receive all
frames passed on the switch that are allowed under the VLAN policy for
the associated port group. This can be useful for intrusion detection
monitoring or if a sniffer needs to analyze all traffic on the network
segment.</p>
<p>When the BIG-IP platform performs SNAT or NAT functions to the network
traffic that is traversing the system it rewrites the destination IP or
source IP address of the traffic depending on the function performed.
This can make troubleshooting captures of network traffic difficult
since with SNAT all traffic seems to have a source IP address of the
BIG-IP system, or with NAT the destination IP address is not the same on
each side of the communications of the BIG-IP.</p>

<p><strong>2.12 - Explain the implications of forwarding virtual servers on the environment security</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7595?sr=42401954">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K7595?sr=42401954</a></p>
<p><strong>Forwarding Virtual Servers</strong></p>
<p>There are two different types of forwarding virtual server, the Layer2
forwarding and IP forwarding.</p>
<p>An IP forwarding virtual server accepts traffic that matches the virtual
server address and forwards it to the destination IP address that is
specified in the request rather than load balancing the traffic to a
pool. Address translation is disabled when you create an IP forwarding
virtual server, leaving the destination address in the packet unchanged.
When creating an IP forwarding virtual server, as with all virtual
servers, you can create either a host IP forwarding virtual server,
which forwards traffic for a single host address, or a network IP
forwarding virtual server, which forwards traffic for a subnet.</p>
<p><strong>Host IP forwarding virtual server</strong></p>
<p>A host IP forwarding virtual server forwards traffic to a single
destination host address. For example, the following configuration
defines a host IP forwarding virtual server that accepts any traffic
arriving on the Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) named external whose
destination is 10.0.0.1 on any service port using any valid TCP/IP
protocol. The traffic is forwarded from the external VLAN to the
destination host at 10.0.0.1.</p>
<p><strong>Network IP forwarding virtual server</strong></p>
<p>A network IP forwarding virtual server forwards traffic to the
destination network. For example, the following configuration example
defines a network IP forwarding virtual server that accepts traffic from
any VLAN bound for any host on the 10.0.0.0/24 network, but only if it
arrives on TCP port 22. Matching traffic is forwarded from the
originating VLAN to the host specified in the client request.</p>
<p>Note: IP forwarding virtual servers are similar to Layer 2 forwarding
virtual servers in that neither one load balances traffic to pool
members, but instead forward directly to the destination address
requested by the client. For more information about Layer 2 forwarding
virtual servers, refer to K8082: Overview of TCP connection setup for
BIG-IP LTM virtual server types.</p>
<p>An IP forwarding virtual server is useful when you want to configure the
BIG-IP system to pass infrastructure-related traffic, such as Internet
Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Emulating stateless IP routing with BIG-IP LTM forwarding virtual servers</strong></p>
<p>The TMOS-based full-proxy model is stateful and connection-orientated by
nature, in contrast to the stateless IP forwarding typically provided by
L3 routers. The BIG-IP LTM system must be specifically configured to
more closely emulate a standard router’s stateless routing behavior by
adjusting the virtual server and protocol profile configurations to
match your requirements.</p>
<p>For the closest approximation of stateless IP forwarding, F5 recommends
that you create an IP forwarding wildcard virtual server. This
configuration accepts traffic and forwards it using the information
contained in the system routing table, regardless of whether it is
associated with an established connection.</p>
<p>Note: The VLANs on which you enable the forwarding virtual server may
vary depending on your routing requirements and restrictions. The
virtual server should be enabled on all VLANs from which it will accept
and route traffic.</p>
<p>The FastL4 profile determines how the system handles the connection
table entries. Enabling the Loose Initiation option allows the system to
initialize a connection when it receives any TCP packet, rather than
requiring a SYN packet for connection initiation. It also provides a
good alternative to the high overhead of connection mirroring. In the
event of a failover, with the Loose Initiation option enabled, the
standby BIG-IP system accepts connections mid-flow, and forwards, as
expected. The Loose Close option allows the system to remove a
connection when the system receives the first FIN packet from either the
client or the server. This will help trim connection table entries as
the connection entry can be removed as soon as the connection officially
closes, and the system does not need to maintain the connection table
entry.</p>
<p>Note: The Loose Close feature is optional, and may impact system
performance because it disables Packet Velocity ASIC (PVA) Acceleration
for the virtual server. For information about PVA Acceleration, refer to
K4832: Overview of PVA Acceleration. The Loose Close feature does not
impact ePVA acceleration. For information about ePVA acceleration, refer
to K12837: Overview of the ePVA feature.</p>
<p>Setting the Idle Timeout allows the system to remove connections from
the connection table when the connections are no longer active. F5
recommends that you use the default timeout of 300 seconds. If you
disable Reset on Timeout, the system removes connection entries from the
connection table once the idle timeout expires, but the system does not
reset the connection. This setting prevents the BIG-IP LTM system from
sending resets when closing an idle connection, it also reduces the need
to use long idle timeouts for long-lived TCP connections, which may go
idle for extended periods of time. For instance, if an application
allows for long periods of inactivity (greater than the configured Idle
Timeout) with no traffic being exchanged, then without this setting, the
BIG-IP LTM system would close both sides of the connection when the
timeout expired. The system would reject any subsequent packets that the
client or server sent in the same TCP connection, since the connection
is no longer valid on the BIG-IP LTM system. However, with Reset on
Timeout disabled, the BIG-IP LTM quietly removes the connection entry
and neither the client nor the server is aware that the communication
channel has timed out. When the client or server begins communicating
again, the Loose Initiation setting allows the BIG-IP LTM system to
re-add the connection to the connection table, and the newly-arrived
packets are forwarded, as expected.</p>
<p>Note: F5 does not recommend that you set the idle timeout for any
virtual server to immediate or indefinite. Setting the timeout to
immediate results in constant writing and deletion of connection entries
for each datagram, creating undesirable overhead. Setting the timeout to
indefinite (or to large values) results in a connection table that grows
until all available memory is consumed, and typically results in an
unplanned failover upon memory exhaustion.</p>
<p>Some protocols have different requirements than others. In which case, a
more specific virtual server allows you to control traffic handling for
specific protocols. A protocol-specific virtual server can help keep
connection table sizes down, and if Last Hop is still used, will help
reduce stale last hop information for short-lived connections. For
instance, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is less stateful than TCP, and
does not typically require as long an idle timeout. To set a specific
timeout for UDP traffic, you can create the wildcard forwarding virtual
server described previously, and a protocol-specific forwarding virtual
server and profile. This virtual server listens for only UDP traffic.
All other IP protocols will be processed by the more general wildcard
forwarding virtual server defined previously.</p>
<p><strong>Forwarding Virtual Servers Security Concerns</strong></p>
<p>Since the forwarding virtual server is not processing traffic to a
specific pool resource traffic can be destined for any IP address in the
subnet that the BIG-IP system is listening on. This may allow traffic to
systems that you did not intend to pass.</p>

<p><strong>2.12 - Explain how to set up and enable SNMP device traps on the LTM device</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K3727">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K3727</a></p>
<p><strong>SNMP trap configuration files</strong></p>
<p>Standard, pre-configured SNMP traps are contained in the
/etc/alertd/alert.conf file. F5 does not recommend, or support, the
addition or removal of traps or any other changes to the alert.conf
file.</p>
<p>Custom, user-defined SNMP traps should be defined in the
/config/user_alert.conf file.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system will process the alert notification specified in the
/config/user_alert.conf file first, if the same alert definition exists
on both of the config files.</p>
<p>Prior to BIG-IP 10.1.0, when the alertd process starts, it creates a
dynamic configuration file by appending the /config/user_alert.conf
file to the /etc/alertd/alert.conf file. The BIG-IP system searches the
dynamic configuration file sequentially for matches. After a match is
found, the trap is generated and no further matches are attempted.</p>
<p>Note: All files in the /config directory, including any customizations
to the /config/user_alert.conf file, are automatically included in the
UCS archive by default. For more information, refer to K4422: Viewing
and modifying the files that are configured for inclusion in a UCS
archive.</p>
<p>Creating custom SNMP traps</p>
<p>Before you create a custom trap, you must determine the unique syslog
messages for which you want the system to send alerts. The message must
not match the matched_message value of any other SNMP trap already
defined in the /etc/alertd/alert.conf file or the
/config/user_alert.conf file.</p>
<p>Note: For information about how to determine which alerts are
pre-configured to trigger an SNMP trap, refer to K6414: Determining
which alerts are pre-configured to trigger an SNMP trap. You may also
examine the alerts from the /config/user_alert.conf file in the same
manner.</p>
<p>To create a custom SNMP trap, perform the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to the command line.</li>
</ol>
<p>2. To back up your /config/user_alert.conf file, type the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">cp</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">user_alert</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">user_alert</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">conf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">SOL3727</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Edit the /config/user_alert.conf file.</li>
</ol>
<p>4. Add a new SNMP trap using the following format:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">alert</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">alert_name</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&lt;matched message&gt;&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="n">snmptrap</span> <span class="n">OID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;.1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.4.0.XXX&quot;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note: Replace &lt;alert_name&gt; with a descriptive name. Do not use an
alert name that exactly matches one already used in the
/etc/alertd/alert.conf file or the /config/user_alert.conf file.
Replace &lt;matched_message&gt; with text that matches the syslog message
that triggers the custom trap. You can specify a portion of the
syslog message text or use a regular expression. F5 recommends that
you do not include the syslog prefix information, such as the date
stamp and process ID, in the match string. Including information of
a variable nature in the match string or regular expression may
result in unexpected false positives or result in no matches at all.
The syslog message you want to trap must not match the
matched_message value of any other SNMP trap defined in the
/etc/alertd/alert.conf file or the /config/user_alert.conf file.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Replace XXX with a number unique to this object ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use any object ID that meets all of the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The object ID is in standard object identifier (OID) format, and within the following range:</li>
</ul>
<p>.1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.4.0.300 through .1.3.6.1.4.1.3375.2.4.0.999</p>
<p>Note: If the OID value is outside the range listed above, a trap
will be sent with the OID specified, but it will not contain any
text within the trap body.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The object ID is in a numeric range that can be processed by your trap receiving tool.</li>
<li>The object ID does not already exist in the /usr/share/snmp/mibs/F5-BIGIP-COMMON-MIB.txt management information base (MIB) file.</li>
<li>The object ID is not already used in another custom trap.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>Save the file and exit the editor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If the alertd process fails to start, examine the newly added
entry to ensure it contains all of the required elements and
punctuation.</p>
<p>Note: To test the newly created trap, refer to K11127: Testing SNMP
traps on the BIG-IP system (9.4.x - 13.x).</p>
<p>Custom SNMP trap example</p>
<p>A message that appears similar to the following example is logged to the
/var/log/ltm file when switchboard failsafe is enabled:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">Sep</span> <span class="mi">23</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">51</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">40</span> <span class="n">bigip1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">askf5</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="n">lacpd</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">27753</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="mi">01160016</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="n">Switchboard</span> <span class="n">Failsafe</span> <span class="n">enabled</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To create a custom SNMP trap that is triggered whenever switchboard
failsafe status changes are logged, add the following trap definition to
the /config/user_alert.conf file:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">alert</span> <span class="n">SWITCHBOARD_FAILSAFE_STATUS</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Switchboard Failsafe (.\*)&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p><strong>2.12 - Describe the implications of port lockdown settings</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-concepts-11-5-0/13.html">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-concepts-11-5-0/13.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Port lockdown</strong></p>
<p>Each self IP address has a feature known as port lockdown. Port lockdown
is a security feature that allows you to specify particular UDP and TCP
protocols and services from which the self IP address can accept
traffic.</p>
<p>You can determine the supported protocols and services by using the tmsh
command tmsh list net self-allow defaults.</p>
<p>If you do not want to use the default setting (Allow None), you can
configure port lockdown to allow either all UDP and TCP protocols and
services (Allow All) or only those that you specify (Allow Custom).</p>
<p>Note: High availability-related traffic from configured peer devices in
a device group might not be subject to port lockdown settings.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13250">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13250</a></p>
<p>The port lockdown feature allows you to secure the BIG-IP system from
unwanted connection attempts by controlling the level of access to each
self IP address defined on the system. Each port lockdown list setting,
defined later in this document, specifies the protocols and services
from which a self IP can accept connections. The system refuses traffic
and connections made to a service or protocol port that is not on the
list.</p>
<p>Port lockdown exceptions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TCP port 1028: In BIG-IP 11.0.0 - 11.3.0 redundant pair
configurations, the system allows <a class="reference external" href="tcp:1028">tcp:1028</a> for connection and
persistence mirroring, regardless of the port lockdown settings.</li>
<li>TCP port 1029 - 1043: Beginning in BIG-IP 11.4.0, the BIG-IP system
maintains a separate mirroring channel for each traffic group. The
port range for each connection channel begins at TCP 1029 and
increments by one for each new traffic group and channel created. By
default, the BIG-IP system allows TCP ports 1029-1043. For more
information, refer to K14894: The BIG-IP system establishes a
separate mirroring channel for each traffic group.</li>
<li>TCP port 4353: When BIG-IP 11.0.0 and later devices are configured in
a synchronization group, peer devices communicate using Centralized
Management Infrastructure (CMI) on <a class="reference external" href="tcp:4353">tcp:4353</a>, regardless of the port
lockdown settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: CMI uses the same port as iQuery <a class="reference external" href="tcp:4353">tcp:4353</a>, but is independent
of iQuery and the port configuration options available for the port.
If you are using iQuery, you must allow port 4353 in your port
lockdown settings.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ICMP: ICMP traffic to the self-IP address is not affected by the port
lockdown list and is implicitly allowed in all cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: In most cases, it is not possible to ping self IP addresses
across Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). For more information,
refer to K3475: The BIG-IP system may not respond to requests for a
self IP address.</p>
<p><strong>Port lockdown setting definitions:</strong></p>
<p>Allow Default</p>
<p>This option allows access to a pre-defined set of network protocols and
services that are typically required in a BIG-IP deployment.</p>
<p>The Allow Default setting specifies that connections to the self IP
address are allowed from the following protocols and services:</p>

<p><strong>Making the BIG-IP Listen for a service</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ltm-concepts-11-5-0/2.html#conceptid">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/ltm-concepts-11-5-0/2.html#conceptid</a></p>
<p>The Big-IP platform is a default deny network platform. You have to
configure the BIG-IP to listen for traffic whether that is for
management or for production traffic. Virtual servers are the listeners
for application traffic services. Some listeners need to be built to
pass more than one type of traffic. And many times, the configuration
will allow either one port or all ports. If you want to restrict it to a
short list of ports, an iRule can be used that will allow the selective
list of ports.</p>
<p>Simply sending a TCP reset to a port scan can tell an intruder a lot
about your environment. By default, the TM.RejectUnmatched BigDB
variable is set to true, and the BIG-IP system sends a TCP RST packet in
response to a non-SYN packet that matches a virtual server address and
port or self IP address and port, but does not match an established
connection. The BIG-IP system also sends a TCP RST packet in response to
a packet that matches a virtual server address, or self IP address, but
specifies an invalid port. The TCP RST packet is sent on the client side
of the connection, and the source IP address of the reset is the
relevant BIG-IP LTM object address or self IP address for which the
packet was destined. If TM.RejectUnmatched is set to false, the system
silently drops unmatched packets.</p>

<p><strong>Address Resolution Protocol on the BIG-IP system</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system is a multi-layer network device, and as such, needs to
perform routing functions. To do this, the BIG-IP system must be able to
find destination MAC addresses on the network, based on known IP
addresses. The way that the BIG-IP system does this is by supporting
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), an industry-standard Layer 3
protocol. Settings for ARP behaviors can be found on the Main tab, click
Network &gt; ARP &gt; Options. You can also see and manage the dynamic and
static ARP entries in ARP cache from the console or the GUI.</p>

<p><strong>Disabling ARP for A Virtual Server’s Address</strong></p>
<p>If you want to control how the BIG-IP handles ARP for a virtual server
you can make a change to the configuration of the virtual address of the
virtual server.</p>
<p><strong>What is a virtual address?</strong></p>
<p>A virtual address is the IP address with which you associate a virtual
server. For example, if a virtual server’s IP address and service are
10.10.10.2:80, then the IP address 10.10.10.2 is a virtual address.</p>
<p>You can create a many-to-one relationship between virtual servers and a
virtual address. For example, you can create the three virtual servers
10.10.10.2:80, 10.10.10.2:443, and 10.10.10.2:161 for the same virtual
address, 10.10.10.2.</p>
<p>You can enable and disable a virtual address. When you disable a virtual
address, none of the virtual servers associated with that address can
receive incoming network traffic.</p>
<p>You create a virtual address indirectly when you create a virtual
server. When this happens, Local Traffic Manager internally associates
the virtual address with a MAC address. This in turn causes the BIG-IP
system to respond to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) requests for the
virtual address, and to send gratuitous ARP requests and responses with
respect to the virtual address. As an option, you can disable ARP
activity for virtual addresses, in the rare case that ARP activity
affects system performance. This most likely occurs only when you have a
large number of virtual addresses defined on the system.</p>

<p><strong>Overview: Configuring DoS Protection event logging</strong></p>
<p>You can configure the BIG-IP system to log information about BIG-IP
system denial-of-service (DoS) events, and send the log messages to
remote high-speed log servers.</p>
<p>Important: The BIG-IP Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM) must be licensed
and provisioned before you can configure DoS Protection event logging.
Additionally, for high-volume logging requirements, such as DoS, ensure
that the BIG-IP system sends the event logs to a remote log server.</p>
<p>When configuring remote high-speed logging of DoS Protection event
logging, it is helpful to understand the objects you need to create and
why, as described here:</p>

<p><strong>Task summary</strong></p>
<p>Perform these tasks to configure logging of DoS Protection events on the
BIG-IP system.</p>
<p>Note: Enabling logging impacts BIG-IP system performance.</p>
<p><strong>Creating a pool of remote logging servers</strong></p>
<p>Before creating a pool of log servers, gather the IP addresses of the
servers that you want to include in the pool. Ensure that the remote log
servers are configured to listen to and receive log messages from the
BIG-IP system.</p>
<p>Create a pool of remote log servers to which the BIG-IP system can send
log messages.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click DNS &gt; Delivery &gt; Load Balancing &gt; Pools or Local Traffic &gt; Pools. The Pool List screen opens.</li>
<li>Click Create. The New Pool screen opens.</li>
<li>In the Name field, type a unique name for the pool.</li>
<li>Using the New Members setting, add the IP address for each remote logging server that you want to include in the pool:<ul>
<li>Type an IP address in the Address field, or select a node address from the Node List.</li>
<li>Type a service number in the Service Port field, or select a service name from the list. Note: Typical remote logging servers require port 514.</li>
<li>Click Add.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click Finished.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Creating a remote high-speed log destination</strong></p>
<p>Before creating a remote high-speed log destination, ensure that at
least one pool of remote log servers exists on the BIG-IP system. Create
a log destination of the Remote High-Speed Log type to specify that log
messages are sent to a pool of remote log servers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the Main tab, click System &gt; Logs &gt; Configuration &gt; Log Destinations. The Log Destinations screen opens.</li>
<li>Click Create.</li>
<li>In the Name field, type a unique, identifiable name for this destination.</li>
<li>From the Type list, select Remote High-Speed Log.</li>
</ol>
<p>Important: If you use log servers such as Remote Syslog, Splunk,
or ArcSight, which require data be sent to the servers in a specific
format, you must create an additional log destination of the
required type, and associate it with a log destination of the Remote
High-Speed Log type. With this configuration, the BIG-IP system can
send data to the servers in the required format. The BIG-IP system
is configured to send an unformatted string of text to the log
servers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>From the Pool Name list, select the pool of remote log servers to
which you want the BIG-IP system to send log messages.</li>

<p><strong>2.12 - (Supplemental Example) Explain how route domains can be used to enforce network segmentation</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-ip-routing-administration-11-5-0/2.html">https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-ip-routing-administration-11-5-0/2.html</a></p>
<p><strong>What is a route domain?</strong></p>
<p>A route domain is a configuration object that isolates network traffic
for a particular application on the network.</p>
<p>Because route domains segment network traffic, you can assign the same
IP address or subnet to multiple nodes on a network, provided that each
instance of the IP address resides in a separate routing domain.</p>
<p>Note: Route domains are compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6 address
formats.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of route domains</strong></p>
<p>Using the route domains feature of the BIG-IP system, you can provide
hosting service for multiple customers by isolating each type of
application traffic within a defined address space on the network.</p>
<p>With route domains, you can also use duplicate IP addresses on the
network, provided that each of the duplicate addresses resides in a
separate route domain and is isolated on the network through a separate
VLAN. For example, if you are processing traffic for two different
customers, you can create two separate route domains. The same node
address (such as 10.0.10.1) can reside in each route domain, in the same
pool or in different pools, and you can assign a different monitor to
each of the two corresponding pool members.</p>
<p><strong>Sample partitions with route domain objects</strong></p>
<p>This illustration shows two route domain objects on a BIG-IP system,
where each route domain corresponds to a separate customer, and thus
resides in its own partition. Within each partition, the customer
created the network objects and local traffic objects required for that
customer’s application (AppA or AppB).</p>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p19.png" src="../../_images/p19.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Sample route domain deployment</strong></p>
<p>A good example of the use of route domains is a configuration for an ISP
that services multiple customers, where each customer deploys a
different application. In this case, the BIG-IP system isolates traffic
for two different applications into two separate route domains. The
routes for each application’s traffic cannot cross route domain
boundaries because cross-routing restrictions are enabled on the BIG-IP
system by default.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p20.png" src="../../_images/p20.png" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>About strict isolation</p>
<p>You can control the forwarding of traffic across route domain boundaries
by configuring the strict isolation feature of a route domain:</p>
<p>If strict isolation is enabled, the BIG-IP system allows traffic
forwarding from that route domain to the specified parent route domain
only. This is the default behavior. Note that for successful isolation,
you must enable the strict isolation feature on both the child and the
parent route domains.</p>
<p>If strict isolation is disabled, the BIG-IP system allows traffic
forwarding from that route domain to any route domain on the system,
without the need to define a parent-child relationship between route
domains. Note that in this case, for successful forwarding, you must
disable the strict isolation feature on both the forwarding route domain
and the target route domain (that is, the route domain to which the
traffic is being forwarded).</p>
